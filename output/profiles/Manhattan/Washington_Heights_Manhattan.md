## Washington Heights

Washington Heights is a neighborhood in the northern part of the borough of Manhattan in New York City . It is named for Fort Washington , a fortification constructed at the highest natural point on Manhattan by Continental Army troops to defend the area from the British forces during the American Revolutionary War . Washington Heights is bordered by Inwood to the north along Dyckman Street , by Harlem to the south along 155th Street , by the Harlem River and Coogan's Bluff to the east, and by the Hudson River to the west.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A dense Upper Manhattan business district anchored by NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and other higher-education campuses, with active retail along Broadway, St. Nicholas and Amsterdam avenues and limited modern commercial construction relative to its population.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Proximity to multiple large waterfront and ridge-top parks and historic attractions such as Fort Tryon Park, the Cloisters, the Little Red Lighthouse, Audubon Terrace, and the Fort Washington Avenue Armory adds recreational and tourism-driven demand to an otherwise utilitarian commercial landscape served by major highways and the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial rents and investment interest have risen with gentrification since the 1990s, but the area remains characterized by small Latino-owned businesses, severe residential crowding, high demand for neighborhood retail and services, and new mixed-use projects like the 22‑story Radio Tower & Hotel bringing office, hotel, and ground-floor retail after decades without major private commercial development.

### Around the Block

Washington Heights is a heavily built-out ridge-top neighborhood that functions as a key institutional and transportation hub for Upper Manhattan. The NewYork–Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center complex between 165th and 168th Streets dominates the western spine, generating continuous demand for medical office, lab, academic, hospitality, and supporting retail uses. Yeshiva University’s Wilf Campus and Boricua College add a steady student and staff population that supports local food, services, and small-format retail on nearby Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. The Fort Washington Avenue Armory, now the New Balance Track and Field Center and National Track & Field Hall of Fame, pulls regional sports traffic, youth events, and spectators, reinforcing demand for hospitality and food-and-beverage uses along the surrounding corridors.

The neighborhood’s geography and infrastructure give it unusual logistics advantages. The George Washington Bridge, the Trans‑Manhattan Expressway, the Alexander Hamilton Bridge, Henry Hudson Parkway, and Harlem River Drive converge here, linking New Jersey, the Bronx, and Manhattan and making the area a historic node for goods and people—an asset that also helped drive the 1980s cocaine trade centered near Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue. Today, that same access underpins bus operations at the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, regional coach services, and heavy subway ridership on the 1 and A/C lines, all of which feed ground-floor retail and service businesses. Commercial corridors such as Broadway, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Amsterdam Avenue are lined with small storefronts, many historically Latino-owned, serving the broader “Little Dominican Republic” trade area that extends into Inwood and part of Hamilton Heights. Recent gentrification, stronger safety metrics, park restorations at Fort Tryon and Highbridge Parks, and new mixed-use construction like the Radio Tower & Hotel on Amsterdam Avenue and 180th Street signal a slow but tangible shift toward higher-value commercial and hospitality uses, even as many legacy operators struggle with rent pressure and extremely low vacancy in the surrounding housing stock.
