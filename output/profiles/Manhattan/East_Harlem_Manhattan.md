## East Harlem

East Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem, or El Barrio, is a neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City, north of the Upper East Side and bounded by 96th Street to the south, Fifth Avenue to the west, and the East and Harlem Rivers to the east and north. Despite its name, it is generally not considered to be a part of Harlem proper, but it is one of the neighborhoods included in Greater Harlem.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** East Harlem is a historically working-class Upper Manhattan neighborhood with significant public housing, older tenement stock, and emerging luxury and mixed-income developments, including planned large-scale residential towers with integrated schools and retail space.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area hosts legacy Italian and Latino commercial institutions such as Rao’s and Patsy’s Pizzeria, the long-standing La Marqueta market under the Park Avenue viaduct, and one of the few major television studios north of Midtown, alongside a growing arts and media presence like the Metropolis studios and MediaNoche gallery.


- **THE MARKET:** Property values climbed through the mid-2000s and gentrification has attracted new luxury developments, national-brand retailers, bars, and restaurants, while the city’s recent rezoning aims to spur new residential, commercial, community-facility, and manufacturing development in a neighborhood that still has high vacancy in upper floors above active ground-floor retail.

### Around the Block

East Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem or El Barrio, has evolved from a rural fringe into a dense mixed-use neighborhood where housing, social services, culture, and commerce intersect. The area’s built environment is dominated by large New York City Housing Authority complexes interspersed with older tenement buildings, many of which line key avenues and cross streets with ground-floor retail. Historic ethnic enclaves gave rise to distinctive commercial corridors: Italian Harlem fostered restaurants and small businesses like Rao’s and the original Patsy’s Pizzeria, while Puerto Rican and broader Latino migration from the early 20th century onward established bodegas, botánicas, and the enclosed La Marqueta street market beneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th and 116th Streets. These legacy enterprises contribute to a streetscape where small-format food retailers and specialty shops remain central to daily commerce, even as supermarket access has lagged and the neighborhood has been characterized as a food desert.

In recent decades, East Harlem’s commercial profile has begun to shift under the pressure of citywide real estate trends and targeted planning efforts. Gentrification and comparatively lower housing costs than the rest of Manhattan have attracted new residents and supported the arrival of national-brand stores, new bars, restaurants, and supermarkets such as Aldi at East River Plaza and a Super FI Emperior Grocery on Lexington Avenue. A major planned 68‑story tower at 321 East 96th Street is slated to incorporate three schools, retail space, and a large mix of affordable and market-rate apartments, signaling growing interest in high-density, transit-oriented development at the southern edge of the neighborhood. Meanwhile, East Harlem has become a modest but notable media and creative hub: the Metropolis studio at 106th Street and Park Avenue has hosted productions like BET’s “106 & Park” and “Chappelle’s Show,” and MediaNoche on Park Avenue and 102nd Street supports technology-based art and film. Together with La Marqueta and numerous small storefronts, these uses illustrate a pattern of adaptive reuse along transit-adjacent corridors. At the policy level, the city’s rezoning initiative is explicitly intended to enable new residential, commercial, community-facility, and manufacturing projects, even as local stakeholders have pushed their own East Harlem Neighborhood Plan to influence how future investment is distributed.

Transportation infrastructure underpins East Harlem’s commercial viability. The IRT Lexington Avenue Line provides multiple local and express subway stations from 96th to 125th Street, while the Second Avenue Subway’s Q train terminus at 96th Street enhances access on the eastern side of the district. Metro-North’s Harlem–125th Street station links local workers and visitors to the Hudson Valley and Connecticut, amplifying the strategic importance of the 125th Street corridor. On the vehicular side, the Triborough (Robert F. Kennedy) Bridge complex and the Willis Avenue, Third Avenue, and Madison Avenue bridges connect East Harlem to the Bronx and Queens, supporting regional flows of people and goods. The East River Plaza complex near FDR Drive exemplifies how proximity to these roadways facilitates big-box retail and grocery uses that draw from a wide catchment area.
