## Red Hook

Red Hook is a neighborhood in western Brooklyn , New York City , United States , within the area once known as South Brooklyn . It is located on a peninsula projecting into the Upper New York Bay and is bounded by the Gowanus Expressway and the Carroll Gardens neighborhood on the northeast, Gowanus Canal on the east, and the Upper New York Bay on the west and south. A prosperous shipping and port area in the early 20th century, the area declined in the latter part of the century. Today, it is home to the Red Hook Houses , the largest housing project in Brooklyn.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A historically industrial, waterfront neighborhood with container terminals, cruise facilities, and big-box retail coexisting with legacy maritime infrastructure and public housing.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Active ferry links, cruise ship calls, and a working container port bring steady visitor and cargo traffic, supporting local retail and service businesses despite limited subway access.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated along the port and waterfront logistics facilities, the IKEA-anchored retail area, and scattered adaptive-reuse spaces, with large tracts of waterfront land subject to planned public-sector redevelopment.

### Around the Block

Red Hook’s commercial identity is rooted in its role as a historic port and shipping hub, positioned on a peninsula between Buttermilk Channel, Gowanus Bay, and the Gowanus Canal. Industrial-era dredging of the Atlantic Basin, Erie Basin, and Gowanus Creek transformed the area into an industrial powerhouse that once handled up to 26,000 ships per year. That legacy continues today through the Red Hook Container Terminal, one of four container facilities in the Port of New York and New Jersey and the only one in Brooklyn equipped to handle container ships. Its working waterfront is further reinforced by the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal at Pier 12, which brings in transatlantic liners like the Queen Mary 2 and major cruise operators such as Carnival Cruise Lines, injecting a regular flow of tourists into the area. These marine uses underpin a mix of logistics, maritime services, and tourism-related commerce that shapes how space is used along the shoreline.

Retail and destination traffic are anchored in part by the 346,000-square-foot IKEA store near the Gowanus Expressway, which has its own dedicated ferry connection to Manhattan. The IKEA development, built on the former Todd Shipyard site and over the historic Red Hook graving dock, drove significant changes to the industrial landscape, including demolition of Civil War–era structures and the conversion of dry-dock infrastructure into parking. This large-format retail use, while controversial, created a high-volume customer draw that supports auxiliary businesses and encourages weekend visitation via buses and ferries. Public transport is relatively sparse, but the B61 and B57 bus routes connect Red Hook to Downtown Brooklyn and Queens, while the nearby F and G subway stations at Carroll Street and Smith–Ninth Streets extend the catchment area for workers and visitors. NYC Ferry’s South Brooklyn route and the free NY Waterway service to IKEA further knit the neighborhood into the broader harbor economy, compensating somewhat for limited rail transit. Against this backdrop, the city’s 2024 move to take control of roughly 120 acres of waterfront land for redevelopment signals an evolving commercial landscape, with potential for new logistics, mixed-use, and waterfront-adjacent business opportunities built on top of Red Hook’s long-standing maritime foundation.
