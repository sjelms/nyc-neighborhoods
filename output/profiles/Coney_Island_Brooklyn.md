## Coney Island

Coney Island is a neighborhood and entertainment area in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn . The neighborhood is bounded by Brighton Beach to its east, Lower New York Bay to the south and west, and Gravesend to the north and includes the subsection of Sea Gate on its west. More broadly, the Coney Island peninsula consists of Coney Island proper, Brighton Beach, and Manhattan Beach. This was formerly the westernmost of the Outer Barrier islands on the southern shore of Long Island , but in the early 20th century it became connected to the rest of Long Island by land fill .

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Coney Island is a historic waterfront entertainment district and neighborhood centered on a dense cluster of independent amusement parks, stadium-scale attractions, and beach-oriented retail along Surf Avenue, the Riegelmann Boardwalk, and the surrounding streets.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite a long period of decline, the area has seen significant reinvestment in attractions like Luna Park, Maimonides Park, the Ford Amphitheater, and the New York Aquarium, creating a diversified visitor economy that combines amusements, live entertainment, foodservice, and cultural institutions.


- **THE MARKET:** The commercial landscape mixes long-standing operators such as Nathan’s Famous with newer destination venues and seasonal amusements, while ongoing rezonings and large-scale residential projects on Surf Avenue increase mixed-use potential and year-round customer bases.

### Around the Block

Coney Island’s commercial core is organized around its amusement district and waterfront, where Surf Avenue and the Riegelmann Boardwalk function as the primary retail and visitor corridors. Along the boardwalk, a continuous public beach frontage connects amusement rides, arcades, food stands, and the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island, all feeding off heavy seasonal pedestrian traffic. The neighborhood’s two modern amusement parks—Luna Park and Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park—anchor this cluster, operating alongside legacy independent rides such as the Cyclone roller coaster, the Wonder Wheel, and the B&B Carousell. These assets, many with landmark protection, support a resilient visitor draw and limit certain types of redevelopment, reinforcing the area’s tourism-focused commercial identity.

Major destination assets extend beyond rides and games. Maimonides Park, opened in 2001 on the former Steeplechase Park site, brings regular stadium-scale traffic for Brooklyn Cyclones baseball and events, which spill over into surrounding food, drink, and retail businesses. The New York Aquarium, rebuilt and expanded after Hurricane Sandy with exhibits such as Ocean Wonders: Sharks, is another year-round institutional anchor that boosts family-oriented visitation. Nonprofit organizations such as Coney Island USA and the Coney Island History Project operate cultural venues and archives that add museum, gallery, and events programming to the mix. Large festivals and events—like the Coney Island Mermaid Parade and other seasonal productions—create peak days for local merchants and short-term vendors along Surf Avenue and the boardwalk. Transit connectivity via the multi-line Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue subway terminal and several bus routes underpins this commercial ecosystem, making the area accessible to visitors from across New York City and supporting a growing base of mixed-use and residential development nearby.
