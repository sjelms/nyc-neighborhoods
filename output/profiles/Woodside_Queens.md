### Around the Block

Woodside’s commercial landscape is deeply tied to its evolution as a transportation hub and working neighborhood in western Queens. Early agriculture and rural estates gradually gave way to a built environment oriented around rail and trolley lines, then later the subway and expressways. By the early 20th century, Woodside’s location on the Long Island Rail Road’s Main Line, along with elevated rapid transit and electrified trolley service, made it unusually accessible and attractive for development. This access supported local employers ranging from the Bulova Watch Company headquarters, located along Interstate 278, to breweries, a major florist, and numerous retail establishments serving both residents and workers. Calvary Cemetery, one of the city’s largest, historically generated ancillary commercial activity, reinforcing Woodside’s role as a service and employment node within Queens.

Today, commercial and community life is concentrated along several key corridors. Roosevelt Avenue, particularly around the 61st Street–Woodside subway and LIRR station, hosts a vibrant mix of restaurants, pubs, and small storefronts that reflect decades of Irish, Latin American, and Asian immigration. The Little Manila section between 63rd and 71st Streets on Roosevelt Avenue features Filipino cafés, restaurants, freight and remittance centers, professional services, and other specialty shops that attract patrons from across the region, including from Long Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Queens Boulevard, Northern Boulevard, and Broadway carry heavy vehicle and bus traffic, providing visibility and access for neighborhood retail, while the preserved trolley barn at Northern Boulevard and 51st Street now operates as the Tower Square Shopping Center. Residential density—ranging from garden apartments and small multifamily buildings to the sizable Woodside Houses public housing complex—supplies a steady local customer base. Excellent transit connectivity via the 7, E, F, M, and R subway services, the LIRR, multiple bus lines, and nearby expressways further strengthens Woodside’s position as a convenient, service-rich environment for small businesses and regional restaurant destinations.
