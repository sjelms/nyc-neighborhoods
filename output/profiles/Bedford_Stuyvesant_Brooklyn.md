### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A dense Brooklyn neighborhood with a strong commercial spine along Fulton Street and multiple north–south retail corridors at Bedford, Nostrand, and Stuyvesant Avenues, supporting a wide mix of small businesses and service uses amid historic brownstone and mixed-use building stock.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its long association with disinvestment, Bed-Stuy combines one of the nation’s largest intact Victorian and brownstone districts with multiple historic districts and growing BID-backed streetscape upgrades that enhance the appeal for restaurants, neighborhood retail, and creative enterprises.


- **THE MARKET:** Significant gentrification since the early 2000s has driven rising rents and real estate prices, attracted Zagat-rated restaurants and new retailers, and focused investment around the Fulton Street–Nostrand Avenue Gateway BID and other key corridors, while existing commercial strips remain heavily neighborhood-serving.
