## Long Island City

Long Island City ( LIC ) is a neighborhood within the New York City borough of Queens .

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Long Island City is a former industrial hub on the western edge of Queens that has undergone extensive rezoning and redevelopment, mixing legacy manufacturing and warehouse buildings with high-rise office and residential towers, institutional campuses, and growing retail and hospitality uses along the waterfront and major corridors like Queens Plaza and Vernon Boulevard.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood combines active industrial pockets, large-scale public housing, and a concentration of cultural institutions and galleries, with adaptive reuse projects such as former bakeries, factories, and trolley shops converted into studios, museums, and media production facilities that attract creative and technology-oriented tenants.


- **THE MARKET:** Once dominated by factories, LIC now features major Class A towers such as One Court Square and Sven, large mixed-use waterfront developments at Queens West and Hunter’s Point South, an expanding Business Improvement District around Queens Plaza, and a diverse tenant base ranging from film and television studios and airlines to niche manufacturers and food producers.

### Around the Block

Long Island City sits at a strategic junction of Queens’ industrial belt and Manhattan’s core business districts, with infrastructure that has historically supported manufacturing and logistics and now underpins a mixed-use commercial ecosystem. The neighborhood’s industrial roots are evident in legacy plants and warehouses repurposed for contemporary uses, such as the former Silvercup bakery now operating as Silvercup Studios, a major television and film production facility visible from multiple subway lines. Other former manufacturing assets, like the Sunshine Bakery and Ford Instrument Company buildings, now house LaGuardia Community College, reinforcing LIC’s role as an education and workforce hub. Additional adaptive reuse can be seen in the Standard Motor Products Building, a 1919 factory that now accommodates tenants including the Jim Henson Company, Society Awards, and a commercial rooftop farm run by Brooklyn Grange, showing how light industrial and creative production can coexist in vertical, multi-tenant environments.

The waterfront has transformed into a high-profile development corridor, particularly at Queens West and Hunter’s Point South, where high-rise residential towers, parks such as Gantry Plaza State Park and Hunters Point South Park, and ferry landings have elevated the area’s appeal to both residents and service-oriented retailers. High-density public housing at Queensbridge Houses and the presence of Queensbridge Park underscore the scale of the local consumer base and workforce. On the commercial side, LIC hosts notable corporate and industrial users: JetBlue Airways chose the Brewster Building at Queens Plaza for its headquarters, while Wonton Foods operates the country’s largest fortune cookie factory and Brooks Brothers runs a sizable tie manufacturing plant. Independent film studio Troma and Standard Motor Products maintain headquarters here, and until relocation, Eagle Electric’s large plant typified the area’s heavy manufacturing legacy. The Long Island City Business Improvement District, managed by the LIC Partnership and steadily expanded since 2005, actively supports property owners and businesses on and around Queens Plaza and other key corridors. With multiple subway lines, two LIRR terminals, ferry stops, and direct access to the Queensboro Bridge, Queens–Midtown Tunnel, and Long Island Expressway, the neighborhood offers strong regional connectivity that continues to attract investment, office users, and production-related enterprises.
