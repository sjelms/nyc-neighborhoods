### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** College Point combines medium-density waterfront housing with a substantial base of industrial, distribution, and light commercial uses, especially in its southern section and within the College Point Corporate Park.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood’s industrial legacy has evolved into a corporate park, big-box retail strip along 20th Avenue, and specialty manufacturers and publishers that leverage proximity to LaGuardia Airport and the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge while retaining older waterfront and brewery-era structures.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial space in late-1980s CPCP buildings reportedly commanded relatively high rents driven by transportation access and limited parking in nearby Flushing, and today the area features a mix of warehouse, distribution, industrial plants, a major printing facility, retail power center, multiplex cinema, and local service businesses.

### Around the Block

College Point presents a layered commercial and industrial landscape shaped by its evolution from factory town to mixed-use corporate hub. The neighborhood’s industrial identity dates back to the 19th century when Conrad Poppenhusen expanded hard rubber manufacturing here, establishing a factory town oriented around his workforce and associated institutions. Through the early 20th century, College Point developed breweries and resort operations, later transitioning into manufacturing for airplane parts and seaplane components through firms like Edo Aircraft Corporation. This industrial base laid the groundwork for today’s light manufacturing and distribution presence, including oil storage facilities, a cement plant, a Pepsi-Cola distribution facility, furniture warehouses, contractors, and other small industrial businesses, particularly in the southern part of the neighborhood.

The creation of the College Point Industrial Park—later rebranded the College Point Corporate Park—marked a major shift toward organized commercial and corporate occupancy. Established on a large tract bounded by the Whitestone Expressway, 15th Avenue, and 127th Street, the park attracted over 100 companies by the mid-1990s and more than 200 companies by the early 2000s. Development in and around the corporate park included several large commercial buildings, a new factory for Crystal Windows and Door Systems, and the substantial New York Times printing plant along the Whitestone Expressway, which enabled expanded nationwide distribution. Retail and entertainment assets followed, anchored by a 20th Avenue strip mall with national chain tenants such as Target, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Waldbaum’s, and other stores, as well as a 12-screen multiplex cinema. Additional mixed-use and lifestyle developments, like the De Point eco-friendly center with hotel, restaurants, spa, and rooftop amenities, reinforce College Point’s role as a regional shopping and service destination.

Transportation connections are central to College Point’s commercial viability. While it has no subway service, the neighborhood is linked by multiple MTA bus routes that tie it to Flushing and wider Queens, and it benefits from adjacency to LaGuardia Airport and the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. Historically, rail and aviation assets such as the Whitestone Branch of the Flushing and North Side Railroad and Flushing Airport supported freight, worker access, and private aviation until their closures. The corporate park’s relatively high rents in the late 1980s were attributed to these strong transportation links coupled with parking constraints in downtown Flushing, making College Point attractive for firms needing road access and on-site parking. At the same time, municipal and infrastructure facilities like the Tallman Island Wastewater Treatment Plant and the large New York City Police Academy campus underscore the area’s importance as a strategic operational location within Queens. With waterfront parks and medium-density residential redevelopment layering around this commercial core, College Point functions as a hybrid neighborhood where logistics, production, retail, and civic uses intersect closely.
