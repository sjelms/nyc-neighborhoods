### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A historically industrial canal-front neighborhood with light to mid-level manufacturing, coworking spaces, and growing hospitality and arts uses along and near the Gowanus Canal.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Adaptive reuse of former industrial and power facilities into arts hubs and coworking spaces has created a distinctive creative and cultural cluster amid an active Superfund cleanup and legacy manufacturing landscape.


- **THE MARKET:** Industrial zoning has historically constrained residential development, but recent and ongoing rezoning discussions, Superfund remediation, and an influx of new apartment buildings along the canal are catalyzing new investment in restaurants, bars, galleries, and flexible workspaces.

### Around the Block

Gowanus is anchored by the Gowanus Canal, a 19th‑century industrial waterway that turned the area into a major hub for manufacturing and shipping. The canal’s legacy is visible in the surrounding building stock and land-use patterns, with much of the neighborhood historically devoted to industrial operations and coal gas manufacturing. Decades of industrial use, combined with combined sewer outflows, severely polluted the canal and adjacent land, which in turn shaped how and where new commercial and residential investment would occur. The federal designation of the Gowanus Canal as a Superfund site in 2010, with more than $500 million allocated for cleanup, signals a long-term environmental remediation effort that will materially affect waterfront usability and development timing.

Today the area is zoned for light to mid‑level manufacturing, which has both limited large-scale residential projects and preserved a base of industrial and production-oriented uses. This industrial zoning helped delay early residential waves in the 2000s, as developers weighed both zoning constraints and the risks of building around a polluted waterway with ongoing sewage overflow issues. In response, stakeholders ranging from business owners and arts organizations to community groups and developers participated in the Bridging Gowanus planning process between 2013 and 2016 to shape a land‑use framework for future rezoning. As environmental cleanup and planning advanced, the commercial profile of Gowanus began to diversify, with a notable rise in coworking spaces, restaurants, bars, and art galleries in the 2010s. A century‑old power station has been converted into Powerhouse Arts, an arts hub that exemplifies the adaptive reuse of heavy industrial infrastructure for creative production. By the mid‑2020s, new apartment buildings were rising along the canal, supporting additional ground‑floor retail and service uses and encouraging newer coworking brands, such as The Shop Workspace, to establish a presence. Transit access via multiple subway lines and bus routes, along with the Gowanus Expressway skirting the southern edge, underpins the neighborhood’s role as a transitioning mixed‑use district still rooted in its manufacturing past.
