### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Morris Park is a compact East Bronx neighborhood organized around Williamsbridge Road and Morris Park Avenue as primary commercial thoroughfares, with supporting institutional anchors such as major hospitals and a medical college at its eastern edge.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area’s strong Italian-American commercial identity, large Columbus Day parade that draws civic and business leaders, and proximity to major medical institutions create steady foot traffic and demand for neighborhood retail and services beyond what its small land area suggests.


- **THE MARKET:** Recent City Council-approved rezoning around the planned Metro-North Morris Park station, combined with a relatively dense population and middle-income profile, positions the area for increased mixed-use development and expanded local-serving retail along its key corridors.

### Around the Block

Morris Park is a small but intensely utilized commercial and institutional hub in the East Bronx, structured around several key corridors that support much of the neighborhood’s daily economic life. Williamsbridge Road and Morris Park Avenue function as the main business spines, where local services, eating establishments, and storefronts cluster to serve a dense resident base of over 25,000 people within just over a third of a square mile. The presence of the United States Postal Service’s Morris Park Station on Williamsbridge Road adds another steady generator of visits and traffic along this corridor. The broader street grid remains low-lying and flat, which supports walkability and ease of local deliveries, important for ground-floor retail and small businesses.

On the eastern edge of the neighborhood, a major healthcare and education complex significantly shapes Morris Park’s commercial profile. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Jacobi Medical Center, Montefiore Medical Center’s Jack D. Weiler Hospital division, the Bronx Psychiatric Center, and Calvary Hospital all sit in or at the edge of the neighborhood, drawing a daily flow of employees, students, patients, and visitors. These institutions create a large, stable daytime population and sustained demand for medical offices, ancillary health services, food and beverage operators, and convenience retail. Public-safety and emergency-services facilities such as NYPD’s 49th Precinct on Eastchester Road and FDNY’s Squad 61 on Williamsbridge Road, as well as EMS Station 20 at Jacobi Medical Center, further reinforce the area’s role as an operational base for city services.

Transportation access underpins this commercial ecosystem. The IRT Dyre Avenue Line’s 5 train serves Morris Park via the Pelham Parkway/Esplanade and Morris Park stations, which sit near the heart of the neighborhood and support both commuters and corridor retail. Multiple Bronx bus routes, including the Bx8, Bx12 and Bx12 SBS, Bx21, Bx31, and the BxM10 express bus, connect Morris Park to northern Bronx, Manhattan, and major shopping destinations such as the Bay Plaza Shopping Center, increasing regional accessibility for workers and shoppers. Bee-Line bus routes BL60, BL61, and BL62 extend that reach into Westchester County, linking Morris Park businesses to customers and employees beyond New York City. Looking ahead, the Penn Station Access project and the city’s 2024 rezoning around the future Metro-North Railroad’s Morris Park and nearby Parkchester/Van Nest stations signal a shift toward transit-oriented development. With up to 7,000 housing units projected across the three rezoned neighborhoods and $500 million in promised infrastructure upgrades, Morris Park’s commercial corridors can expect rising demand for retail, services, and community-facing uses over time.
