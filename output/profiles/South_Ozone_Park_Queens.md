### Around the Block

South Ozone Park occupies a strategic position in southwestern Queens, just north of John F. Kennedy International Airport and framed by key regional infrastructure. To the west lies Aqueduct Racetrack, giving the neighborhood an immediate connection to a legacy entertainment and employment anchor, while the Van Wyck Expressway forms a major eastern edge and conduit to the airport. This siting near critical transportation facilities naturally supports a web of small businesses that serve both local residents and transient users moving along these corridors. Rockaway Boulevard emerges as the neighborhood’s main business strip, functioning as a spine of commercial activity with retail, food, and service operators that depend on steady vehicular and transit flows.

Liberty Avenue provides a second commercial arm, described as one of South Ozone Park’s main sources of revenue, underscoring the importance of small-scale commerce to the local economy. The commercial pattern suggests a corridor-based marketplace: storefronts that can capitalize on foot traffic from nearby A train stations and bus routes, as well as car traffic headed to and from the airport and Belt Parkway. The Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q37, Q41, Q51, Q80, Q112 and QM18 buses link the neighborhood to broader Queens and Manhattan, feeding customers and workers into these corridors throughout the day. Multiple A train stations—104th Street, 111th Street, Lefferts Boulevard, Aqueduct Racetrack, and North Conduit Avenue—reinforce the transit-oriented nature of its commercial activity, giving Rockaway Boulevard and Liberty Avenue sustained access to a large labor and customer pool. Although not characterized by heavy industry in the text, South Ozone Park’s adjacency to major highways and airport-related routes, along with high car-theft rates tied to the Belt Parkway, highlight the intensity of vehicle movement through and around the area. Together, these transportation assets and business strips create a neighborhood profile defined by corridor commerce, service-sector employment, and strong connectivity to the larger regional economy.
