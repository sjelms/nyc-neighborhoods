### Around the Block

East New York presents a complex commercial and industrial landscape shaped by both historic rail infrastructure and contemporary large-format development. The neighborhood’s northwest quadrant hosts the 44-block East Brooklyn Industrial Park, established in 1980 by the New York City Public Development Corporation and bounded by Atlantic Avenue, Sheffield Avenue, Sutter Avenue, and Powell Street. This industrial zone anchors light manufacturing and distribution functions close to major arterials and rail freight on the Bay Ridge Branch, which also demarcates East New York’s western border. The presence of multiple New York City Subway yards (East New York Yard, Livonia Yard, and Pitkin Yard), together with the East New York Bus Depot and MTA Bus Company’s Spring Creek Bus Depot, reinforces the area’s role as a critical operating hub in the region’s transit and logistics network, even though these facilities are not open to the public.

On the southern side of the neighborhood, Spring Creek and Starrett City illustrate a different commercial model built around superblock planning and auto access. Gateway Center in Spring Creek, developed on land near Jamaica Bay, is a suburban-style shopping complex with multiple large stores, structured as two phases that opened in 2002 and 2014. It draws regional shoppers via connections to Belt Parkway, Conduit Avenue, Linden Boulevard, and Flatlands Avenue, supporting a concentration of big-box and destination retail. Nearby, the Starrett City (Spring Creek Towers) development integrates 5,881 apartments with eight parking garages, a community center, recreational fields, and an on-site shopping center across 153 acres, creating a self-contained residential and retail environment with significant structured parking. Within East New York’s subsections, Liberty Avenue in City Line serves as a primary commercial corridor with restaurants, shopping stores, and food markets catering to a diverse international population. These retail strips, combined with the industrial park and transit depots, position East New York as a key node for service, retail, and logistics activity at Brooklyn’s eastern edge.

Transit assets significantly shape commercial viability throughout East New York. Broadway Junction functions as a major intermodal node, carrying the A, C, J, Z, and L subway lines and connecting to multiple bus routes, while the East New York station on the Long Island Rail Road’s Atlantic Branch adds regional rail access. Subway coverage extends across the neighborhood, with the 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the New Lots Line, the L on the Canarsie Line, the A and C on the Fulton Street Line, and the J and Z on the Jamaica Line, all intersecting key corridors such as Atlantic Avenue, Liberty Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue. This density of rail and bus service enhances labor force access to the industrial park, Gateway Center, and local retail strips. Meanwhile, rezoning in 2016 and conversion of several NYCHA properties to RAD PACT Section 8 management have drawn public–private capital into upgrading housing infrastructure, indirectly influencing surrounding ground-floor and neighborhood-serving retail demand. Community initiatives like East New York Farms have increased productive use of vacant lots and improved streetscape conditions, which can further support small-scale commercial activity.
