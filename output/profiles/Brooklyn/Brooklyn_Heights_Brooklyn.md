### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Brooklyn Heights is a historic, low-rise neighborhood with brownstone rowhouses, a modest number of high-rise cooperatives, and limited large-scale redevelopment due to its landmarked historic district status.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The Brooklyn Heights Promenade and Brooklyn Bridge Park create a strong waterfront amenity with skyline views, while repurposed institutional and religious buildings, former hotels, and landmark bank structures add character to the commercial fabric.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity clusters mainly along Montague Street, Court Street, and Cadman Plaza, where bank buildings, educational institutions, libraries, and former hotel properties occupy valuable mixed-use and office/retail space under tight historic-preservation constraints.

### Around the Block

Brooklyn Heights presents a commercially modest but strategically located district on a bluff directly across the East River from Manhattan. Its most visible assets are legacy institutional and hospitality properties rather than big-box or warehouse uses. Historic hotels such as the St. George, the Margaret, the Bossert, Leverich Towers, and the Pierrepont mark an earlier era of visitor and residential density and still define much of the local skyline, even as many have transitioned from pure lodging to other institutional or residential functions. Montague Street and the surrounding core host several architecturally significant bank buildings, including the Brooklyn Trust Company Building, the People’s Trust Building, and the National Title Guaranty Building, reinforcing the neighborhood’s long-standing role as a financial and professional-services address rather than an industrial zone. The Jehovah’s Witnesses’ former world headquarters at 25 Columbia Heights and their extensive portfolio of restored historic buildings, including the former Hotel Bossert on Montague Street, illustrate how large single users can shape and later unlock substantial blocks of commercial and quasi-commercial space.

Education and culture function as quiet but powerful commercial anchors. St. Francis College occupies half a city block on Remsen Street, drawing thousands of students and staff daily, while Brooklyn Law School and K–12 institutions such as St. Ann’s School and Packer Collegiate Institute generate steady demand for food, services, and small-format retail on surrounding streets. The Center for Brooklyn History (formerly the Brooklyn Historical Society) at Pierrepont and Clinton adds a cultural institution into the mix, complementing a network of prominent churches and cathedrals that occupy key corner sites and reinforce low-rise massing. On the waterfront, Brooklyn Bridge Park now lines the shoreline of the East River, with ferry landings at Piers 1 and 6 adding visitor traffic and improving regional access. That park, together with the Brooklyn Heights Promenade cantilevered above the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, has turned the edge of the neighborhood into a high-value recreational frontage that benefits nearby food, beverage, and service businesses. Transit connectivity is excellent, with multiple subway lines converging at nearby High Street, Jay Street–MetroTech, Clark Street, and Borough Hall/Court Street, effectively integrating the neighborhood into the broader Brooklyn and Manhattan office and institutional markets while supporting small-scale commercial uses on its principal corridors.
