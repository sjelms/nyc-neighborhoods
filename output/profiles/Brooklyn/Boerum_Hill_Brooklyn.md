### Around the Block

Boerum Hill is a small but commercially notable neighborhood in northwestern Brooklyn, defined by its dense historic fabric and a pair of strong retail corridors. The main commercial activity concentrates along Smith Street and Atlantic Avenue, where independent boutiques, restaurants, and design-oriented businesses line the streets. These corridors function as neighborhood-serving retail and dining destinations while also drawing shoppers from surrounding areas, supporting a steady flow of foot traffic. The Atlantic Avenue design district highlights home and design-focused tenants, indicating demand from higher-income residents and a customer base that extends beyond the immediate neighborhood. Smith Street’s well-known restaurant row further reinforces Boerum Hill’s role as a dining destination within Brooklyn.

Cultural and creative uses are particularly prominent and add to the commercial mix. The neighborhood is home to art galleries operated by local artists, as well as institutions such as The Invisible Dog Art Center, Roulette, Issue Project Room, and nearby BAM, which together form a strong cluster of arts and performance venues. These cultural anchors enhance evening and weekend activity for nearby restaurants, bars, and small retailers. The presence of the Brooklyn High School of the Arts on Dean Street and Third Avenue introduces an institutional component that supports daytime activity and related services. A branch of the Brooklyn Public Library at Fourth Avenue and Pacific Street, opened in 1905 as a Carnegie library, provides another civic draw near the eastern edge of the neighborhood.

Historically, Boerum Hill’s built environment emerged largely between 1840 and 1870, with rows of three-story houses that have since been protected within the Boerum Hill Historic District. Many structures were once boarding houses serving workers connected to nearby industrial and infrastructure projects, reflecting a legacy of labor and transient housing. The nearby union hall for ironworkers and the concentration of Mohawk ironworkers in the area, who worked on bridges and skyscrapers and formed the community known as “Little Caughnawaga,” tie the neighborhood’s past closely to the city’s construction economy. Landmark designation beginning in 1973 and National Register recognition in 1983 have helped preserve the architecture and streetscape quality that now support a high-value residential market and complementary commercial uses. Together these elements make Boerum Hill a small but commercially vibrant district integrated into a larger cluster of adjacent neighborhoods including Downtown Brooklyn, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Gowanus, Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, and Park Slope.
