## East Williamsburg

East Williamsburg is a neighborhood in the northwestern portion of Brooklyn , New York City , United States. East Williamsburg consists roughly of what was the 3rd District of the Village of Williamsburgh and what is now called the East Williamsburg In-Place Industrial Park (EWIPIP), bounded by the neighborhoods of Northside and Southside Williamsburg to the west, Greenpoint to the north, Bushwick to the south and southeast, and both Maspeth and Ridgewood in Queens to the east. Much of this area is still referred to as either Bushwick, Williamsburg, or Greenpoint with the term East Williamsburg falling out of use since the 1990s.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A mixed-use, formerly industrial Brooklyn neighborhood anchored by the East Williamsburg In-Place Industrial Park, with warehouses, factories, loft conversions, and active commercial corridors along Graham Avenue, Grand Street, and Metropolitan Avenue.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Decommissioned factories and warehouses have created opportunities for adaptive reuse such as loft buildings on McKibbin Street, attracting artists, students, and creative enterprises alongside long-standing Italian and Latin American businesses and markets like Moore Street Market.


- **THE MARKET:** The eastern half of the neighborhood remains largely industrially zoned with active warehouses and factories, while rising rents, increasing residential competition, and retail activity on major avenues reflect growing commercial demand and ongoing transition from heavy and light industry.

### Around the Block

East Williamsburg occupies a strategic position in northwestern Brooklyn, combining a long industrial legacy with evolving commercial uses. The eastern half of the neighborhood forms the East Williamsburg Industrial Park (EWIP/EWIPIP), one of eight In-Place Industrial Parks in New York City, and is mostly zoned for industry with warehouses and factories dominating the landscape. This district is managed by the East Williamsburg Valley Industrial Development Corporation, which focuses on attracting businesses, assisting existing firms, and expanding job opportunities, marking the area as a deliberate hub for industrial and commercial activity. Historically the area included gas infrastructure such as the cylindrical natural gas holders on Maspeth Avenue, and the industrial zone near Newtown Creek and Interstate 278 remains central to its economic identity.

Retail and small business corridors knit the industrial fabric into the surrounding residential and mixed-use context. Graham Avenue, Grand Street, and Metropolitan Avenue operate as the main shopping districts, with dual cultural branding on Graham Avenue as "Avenue of Puerto Rico" to the south of Grand Street and "Via Vespucci" to the north, reflecting long-standing Italian and Puerto Rican commercial communities. Moore Street Market, known as La Marqueta de Williamsburg, serves as a key Latin American retail and market anchor. As factories and warehouses east of Bushwick Avenue are decommissioned due to the departure of heavy and light industry, some buildings, such as the McKibbin Street lofts, have shifted toward studio and loft-style use that supports artists, students, and creative professionals. Proximity to Manhattan and several major universities, combined with strong subway and bus access, has intensified demand and raised rents, making space more competitive for both commercial and residential tenants. At the same time, the industrial park’s protection and management help retain manufacturing and logistics uses, ensuring that East Williamsburg remains a critical employment and production node on Brooklyn’s north side.
