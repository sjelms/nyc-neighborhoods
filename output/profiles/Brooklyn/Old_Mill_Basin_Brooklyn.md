## Old Mill Basin

Mill Basin is a residential neighborhood in southeastern Brooklyn, New York City. It is on a peninsula abutting Jamaica Bay and is bordered by Avenue U on the northwest and the Mill Basin/Mill Island Inlet on its remaining sides. Mill Basin is adjacent to the neighborhood of Bergen Beach to the northeast, Flatlands to the northwest, Marine Park to the southwest, and Floyd Bennett Field and the former Barren Island to the southeast. Mill Basin also contains a subsection called Old Mill Basin, north of Avenue U.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Old Mill Basin is the northern, inland section of Mill Basin, defined as the portion of the neighborhood north of Avenue U, with primarily detached frame houses and limited but concentrated retail and service activity along key corridors.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its largely residential zoning, Old Mill Basin benefits from proximity to major regional retail at Kings Plaza mall and Mill Plaza Mall, recreational waterfront uses nearby, and remaining legacy industrial buildings that hint at the area’s historic heavy-industry and port-related uses.


- **THE MARKET:** The broader Mill Basin/Old Mill Basin area features predominantly one- and two-family housing supported by local family-owned shops and restaurants along Strickland Avenue and Avenue U, with a heavy-industry zone between Avenue U and the Mill Basin waterway and Brooklyn’s largest indoor shopping center, Kings Plaza, anchoring the main commercial market.

### Around the Block

Old Mill Basin sits just north of Avenue U, embedded within the larger Mill Basin area that has evolved from a heavy industrial waterfront to a low-rise neighborhood anchored by local retail and major regional shopping. Historically, this part of southeast Brooklyn was closely tied to Jamaica Bay’s working waterfront, where lead-smelting, refining, and other heavy industrial operations clustered along the Mill Island shoreline. Over time, much of that activity receded, but the imprint remains in the zoning pattern: Mill Basin is predominantly residential, yet the band between Avenue U and the Mill Basin waterway is still zoned for heavy industry, leaving a pocket of industrial and warehouse potential near Old Mill Basin’s southern edge. Some lead factories from the 20th century remain standing, albeit many are derelict, providing adaptive reuse opportunities or posing longer-term redevelopment questions.

Avenue U functions as a defining spine, separating Old Mill Basin from the Mill Island peninsula while carrying much of the area’s day-to-day commercial traffic. Along Avenue U and Strickland Avenue, commercial activity is mainly composed of family-owned shops and restaurants serving both the residential catchment and visitors drawn by larger regional destinations. The 23-acre Kings Plaza shopping mall at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue is positioned on Mill Basin’s western side and is Brooklyn’s largest indoor shopping center, acting as a primary retail anchor and employment hub for the surrounding neighborhoods, including Old Mill Basin. Nearby, Mill Plaza Mall, a strip center at Mill and Strickland Avenues, adds supplemental neighborhood-serving retail. Though transit access is limited—with no subway station in walking distance—bus routes and express services connect the area to other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan, supporting retail staffing and customer access. The Belt Parkway and the reconstructed Mill Basin Bridge enhance vehicular connectivity to Queens and the broader metropolitan road network, while navigable channels and marinas along Mill Basin Inlet maintain a niche for marine-related commerce and recreation close to Old Mill Basin. Together, these elements create a commercial environment where neighborhood retail, regional mall traffic, and residual industrial zoning converge in a relatively low-density Brooklyn setting.
