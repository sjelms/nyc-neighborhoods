### Around the Block

Canarsie’s commercial identity is anchored by a mix of auto-oriented shopping centers, traditional corridors, and older industrial assets tied to Jamaica Bay. The most prominent retail concentration is Canarsie Plaza on Avenue D, a 278,000-square-foot open-air mall that draws regional shoppers and provides large-format space uncommon in many Brooklyn neighborhoods. Right next door, the Brooklyn Terminal Market specializes in horticultural products, selling plants, trees, and fruits, which generates steady wholesale- and trade-oriented traffic in addition to retail visitors. Smaller-scale commercial storefronts continue to line Rockaway Parkway, Flatlands Avenue, and Remsen Avenue, functioning as everyday service corridors for the neighborhood’s dense housing stock. These corridors benefit from strong bus connectivity and the L train terminus, supporting both worker access and customer flow.

Historically, the Jamaica Bay shoreline at Canarsie evolved from a fishing and resort economy into a more mixed-use waterfront. Early 20th-century initiatives attempted to position Canarsie Pier and the surrounding coast as a seaport, bringing in industrial tenants such as an asphalt company and a construction firm. Although the full port vision was never realized, the construction of Canarsie Pier and related dredging works permanently oriented part of the neighborhood’s land use toward maritime, industrial, and transportation functions. Later, the city-sponsored Flatlands Industrial Park on a 93-acre tract between East 99th and 108th Streets and the Bay Ridge Branch rail line created a formal industrial complex, marking Canarsie as one of New York’s early examples of publicly backed industrial development. Today, transit continues to underpin local commerce: the BMT Canarsie Line’s Rockaway Parkway terminal, the East 105th Street station, and a dense network of bus routes including the B6, B17, B42, B82/B82 SBS, B103, and BM2 make the area accessible to workers, shoppers, and students alike. The Belt Parkway’s access at Canarsie Pier adds a vehicular gateway that supports both regional visitors to the waterfront amenities and logistical movements to and from the industrial and retail sites. Together, these elements give Canarsie a commercial profile that blends neighborhood retail, specialized markets, and legacy industrial infrastructure along a changing waterfront.
