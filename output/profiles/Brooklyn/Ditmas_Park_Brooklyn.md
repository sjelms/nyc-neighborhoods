## Ditmas Park

Ditmas Park is a historic district in the neighborhood of Flatbush in Brooklyn, New York City. The traditional boundaries of Ditmas Park, including Ditmas Park West, are Ocean Avenue and greater Flatbush to the east, Dorchester Road and the Prospect Park South neighborhood to the north, Coney Island Avenue and the Kensington neighborhood to the west, and Newkirk Avenue to the south. The name Ditmas Park is often used as a shorthand for the several neighborhoods that comprise the larger area of Victorian Flatbush.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Ditmas Park is a historic subarea of Flatbush with a small commercial district along Cortelyou Road and multiple secondary retail corridors on Newkirk Avenue, Coney Island Avenue, Foster Avenue, and Church Avenue that serve the surrounding Victorian housing stock.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its primarily residential character, Ditmas Park has become a recognized food and nightlife destination, with Cortelyou Road hosting delis, bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and venues that attract both local and well-known artists, as well as frequent film and TV productions seeking a suburban backdrop.


- **THE MARKET:** The area’s commercial inventory is concentrated in low-rise, street-level spaces on the main corridors, which have seen increased commercialization and gentrification, including the Flatbush Food Co-op and more upscale restaurants, supported by strong subway and bus access and steady demand from a growing, higher-income local population.

### Around the Block

Ditmas Park sits within greater Flatbush as a distinctive historic district, but its economic activity is increasingly shaped by a set of compact commercial corridors. Cortelyou Road stands out as the primary spine, with a mix of delis, bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and the Flatbush Food Co-op, as well as more upscale dining options. This retail mix has evolved alongside rapid gentrification and an influx of younger residents and artists, which has translated into more foot traffic and stronger evening and weekend trade for operators. Newkirk Avenue, Coney Island Avenue, Foster Avenue, and Church Avenue add further layers of neighborhood-serving retail, providing continuous ground-floor commercial frontages that support everyday services and small businesses. Together these corridors function as the commercial engine for a broader Victorian streetscape, drawing spend not only from Ditmas Park but from adjacent Flatbush and Kensington.

Cortelyou Road’s venues also play a cultural and entertainment role, regularly hosting local musicians and more established artists, which helps extend commercial activity into the late hours and supports bar, restaurant, and café revenues. Media exposure has reinforced this identity: in 2009 Time Out New York named Ditmas Park one of the best neighborhoods in New York City for food, a theme echoed in coverage by The New York Times and AM New York, further raising the profile of local operators. The neighborhood’s stock of large Victorian homes gives the area a distinctive, almost suburban visual character that is frequently used for movie and TV filming, creating periodic demand from production crews and related support services. Transit connectivity is a key commercial asset, with the B and Q trains and several express and local bus routes providing direct access for workers, customers, and visitors to the commercial strips. While much of the district remains residential, the ongoing commercialization of its main avenues positions Ditmas Park as a small but notable food, culture, and neighborhood retail cluster within Brooklyn’s broader retail and creative economy.
