### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Ocean Hill is a submarket of Bedford–Stuyvesant with ongoing reinvestment, where formerly abandoned buildings, brownstones, and large tracts of retail space are being rehabilitated and repositioned.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The Broadway Junction subsection offers significant light commercial and industrial zoning, underused parcels, and a concentration of transit infrastructure that city agencies are targeting for mixed-use and transportation-hub redevelopment.


- **THE MARKET:** Gentrification, comparatively lower rents than nearby Brownsville and eastern Crown Heights, and substantial retail space have attracted real estate developers aiming to reposition Ocean Hill similarly to Fort Greene–Clinton Hill, with planned mixed residential, commercial, and industrial projects around Broadway Junction.

### Around the Block

Ocean Hill sits at the eastern edge of central Brooklyn as a subsection of Bedford–Stuyvesant, carrying a layered history of industrial structures, tenement housing, and more recent reinvestment. Historically affected by the 1977 blackout, the area saw warehouse fires and abandonment that paralleled disinvestment patterns in the South Bronx, leaving behind vacant lots and damaged building stock that would later become opportunities for redevelopment. Starting in the 1990s, Ocean Hill began a period of revitalization as many of these abandoned buildings and sites were rehabilitated, laying the groundwork for a new phase of commercial and residential activity. The neighborhood’s identity is commercially intertwined with its neighbors, and many residents and stakeholders reference it as Bedford-Stuyvesant/Ocean Hill in real estate and planning contexts, in part to distinguish it from adjacent Brownsville.

A major commercial and infrastructural anchor is Broadway Junction, a sub-sub-neighborhood defined by Broadway, Atlantic Avenue, Rockaway Avenue, and Van Sinderen Avenue. This district is mostly zoned for light commercial and industrial use, with some low-rise residential properties, and is bisected by the Atlantic Avenue/LIRR viaduct. That physical division, combined with small blocks and underused streets, parcels, and public spaces, has led to a long-standing characterization of the area as blighted and largely overlooked by surrounding communities. However, city agencies now see those same underutilized assets as a strategic opportunity. Plans call for adding mixed-use areas, rezoning for a combination of residential, commercial, and industrial development, and significantly improving transit connectivity. The New York City Department of Transportation has proposed transforming Broadway Junction into a transportation hub, with integrated residential development to the west toward Ocean Hill and mixed-use industrial and commercial properties to the east. With the A, C, J, L, and Z subway lines converging at Broadway Junction and nearby Long Island Rail Road service at East New York, the district is poised to become a more active node for both commuters and businesses. Combined with federally backed redevelopment like the HOPE VI rebuilding of Prospect Plaza Houses and efforts to emulate successful mixed-use neighborhoods such as Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, Ocean Hill is evolving into a more prominent player in Brooklyn’s commercial and light-industrial landscape.
