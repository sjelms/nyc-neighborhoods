### Around the Block

Flatbush functions as one of central Brooklyn’s major commercial and institutional centers, built on a long history of transportation-driven growth. Early Native American paths became significant roads, and by the late 19th century Flatbush Avenue had emerged as the primary north–south spine. Rail connections, starting with the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway in the 1870s and later the electrified Brooklyn & Brighton Beach Railroad, tied the area to both Coney Island and downtown Brooklyn, dramatically increasing accessibility for workers, shoppers, and visitors. These transit links laid the groundwork for Flatbush’s evolution from a rural farming town into a high-density, mixed-use neighborhood filled with storefronts, apartment houses, institutions, and entertainment venues. 

By the early 20th century, Flatbush supported an extensive array of commercial and cultural uses, with movie palaces such as Loew’s Kings Theatre and department stores like Sears Roebuck rising alongside new multifamily housing. Church and Flatbush Avenues developed into a busy entertainment and retail district, while a second node formed at Flatbush, Avenue H, and Nostrand Avenue, now known as the Junction. The city’s decision to build Brooklyn College in 1935 added a powerful institutional anchor whose 35-acre campus straddles Flatbush and Midwood, generating ongoing demand for retail, services, and transit. Over time, Flatbush’s commercial profile adapted to demographic change, with storefronts and small businesses shifting to serve Jewish, Afro-Caribbean, Haitian, South Asian, and other immigrant communities. Community development organizations, including the Flatbush Development Corporation and the Flatbush Avenue BID, have played a key role in stabilizing and upgrading the commercial core after periods of disinvestment and crime. In the 21st century, the Junction’s redevelopment—highlighted by Target’s largest-ever store—underscored the area’s draw for large-format retail, while city-backed designations of Little Caribbean and Little Haiti recognized the strength of local cultural economies that continue to define Flatbush’s business environment.
