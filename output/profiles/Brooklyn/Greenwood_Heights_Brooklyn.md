## Greenwood Heights

Greenwood Heights is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, named partially after the adjacent Green-Wood Cemetery by real estate developers. Greenwood Heights is a part of Brooklyn Community District 7 along with Windsor Terrace, Sunset Park and South Slope. The much-debated borders are roughly the Prospect Expressway to the north, Gowanus Canal and Upper New York Bay to the west, Eighth Avenue to the east, and 39th Street to the south (along the southern boundary of the Green-Wood Cemetery and northern boundary of the 36th-38th Street Yard and South Brooklyn Railway ).

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Greenwood Heights is a mixed-use neighborhood on Brooklyn’s waterfront-adjacent west side, historically tied to the working Brooklyn waterfront and the Bush Terminal/Industry City complex west of Third Avenue and the Gowanus Expressway.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area combines proximity to industrial and logistics assets with an eclectic building stock and ongoing reinvestment, with some older wood-frame houses being restored to their early-1900s appearance alongside newer infill.


- **THE MARKET:** Rezoning in November 2005 curtailed large-scale new development, but triggered a wave of luxury condominium construction and extensive home renovations in a building stock previously dominated by 1- and 2-family houses.

### Around the Block

Greenwood Heights sits at a strategic junction between the historic working Brooklyn waterfront and upland residential blocks that have seen steady reinvestment. In the 19th through mid-20th centuries, its economy was closely bound to the Brooklyn waterfront, an area that functioned as a significant employment base and logistics node. During the mid-20th century, what is now Greenwood Heights was also referred to as Bush Terminal, a name that extended over what is now the Industry City complex, located west of Third Avenue and the Gowanus Expressway. This industrial and warehouse landscape anchored the area’s economic role and still frames how it relates to nearby freight yards and waterfront infrastructure.

The modern neighborhood retains this industrial adjacency but has also undergone substantial real estate repositioning. After the area from 36th Street to the Prospect Expressway was incorporated into Sunset Park in 1966, Greenwood Heights emerged as its own designation by the 1980s and was increasingly rebranded in the 2000s as gentrification progressed across South Brooklyn. A key policy milestone was the rezoning of November 2005, which curbed some types of new development but coincided with an influx of luxury condominium projects into a built environment that had largely consisted of 1- and 2-family homes. Since then, capital investment has often taken the form of gut renovations, as well as historically minded restorations of neglected c. 1900 wood-frame houses. These changes, layered onto an eclectic mix of wood frame, vinyl-sided, and brick structures, differentiate Greenwood Heights from Park Slope to the north and Sunset Park to the south. Transit access via multiple BMT Fourth Avenue Line subway stations and two bus routes enhances connectivity to the broader Brooklyn labor and consumer markets, reinforcing the neighborhood’s potential for small-scale commercial, institutional, and service-oriented uses along its corridors.

The presence of several schools, including P.S. 172, P.S. 295, M.S. 88, the Hellenic Classical Charter School, and the Al-Noor School on 4th Avenue, also creates steady daytime population and institutional anchors. These educational uses contribute to foot traffic patterns that support ancillary retail and service opportunities on nearby avenues, particularly 4th Avenue. At the same time, Greenwood Heights continues to overlap administratively and perceptually with Sunset Park and South Slope, reflecting its transitional character between established residential markets and long-standing industrial assets nearer the bay and rail yards. This overlap, along with its border at the Gowanus Canal and Upper New York Bay to the west and its proximity to the 36th–38th Street Yard and South Brooklyn Railway, ties the neighborhood to regional freight and maritime activity even as its building stock trends more mixed and upgraded. Overall, Greenwood Heights balances industrial heritage, rezoning-driven change, and improving transit-supported accessibility in a compact area of Brooklyn that remains commercially and institutionally active.
