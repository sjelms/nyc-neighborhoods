## Georgetown

Bergen Beach is a residential neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn , New York City . It is located on a peninsula abutting Jamaica Bay in the southeastern portion of the borough, and is bordered by Mill Basin and the neighborhood of the same name to the south and west; the neighborhood of Flatlands to the northwest; Paerdegat Basin and the neighborhood of Canarsie to the northeast; and Jamaica Bay and the Belt Parkway to the east. Bergen Beach contains a sub-neighborhood named Georgetown. The vast majority of residents are white, and the neighborhood generally has a suburban quality.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Georgetown is a sub-neighborhood within predominantly residential Bergen Beach, with low-density one- and two-family housing and limited but focused retail anchored by the Georgetown Shopping Center and a strip mall that retains the 'Georgetowne' name.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its distance from the subway and limited transit, Georgetown offers a suburban-style environment within Brooklyn, proximity to recreational waterfront uses, and access to nearby parks and the Gateway National Recreation Area.


- **THE MARKET:** Zoning is predominantly residential with small commercial overlays, recreational waterfront uses, and a strip along Bergen Basin zoned for light industrial uses, providing limited opportunities for neighborhood retail and light industrial/warehouse tenants alongside established gated and condominium developments.

### Around the Block

Georgetown sits as a clearly defined subsection of Bergen Beach, bounded by Ralph Avenue to the west, Avenue N to the south, Avenue U to the southeast, and Paerdegat Basin to the northeast. Its commercial life is modest but focused, with the Georgetown Shopping Center serving as the primary retail hub for the immediate area and for much of Bergen Beach, and a strip mall that preserves the historic 'Georgetowne' branding from an unrealized 1960s housing concept. These retail centers accommodate everyday neighborhood needs in an area otherwise characterized by low-rise, one- and two-family residential structures and a distinctly suburban block pattern. The broader Bergen Beach–Georgetown area includes one of the few gated communities in New York City, the Mill Harbor Condominiums, adding a contemporary multifamily component that contrasts with older bungalows and detached houses nearby.

Commercial and light industrial activity is constrained by zoning, but there are notable pockets that matter for commercial real estate. Both Bergen Beach and Georgetown are zoned as predominantly residential neighborhoods with one- or two-family residences, with small commercial overlays and recreational waterfront uses, and a strip along Bergen Basin zoned for light industrial uses. This industrial strip, together with marina-related uses and nearby waterfront recreation, offers niche opportunities for boat-related services, storage, and small-scale industrial operators needing proximity to Jamaica Bay. The area’s relative remoteness from the subway system has reinforced a car-oriented pattern of use: the Belt Parkway (Shore Parkway) skirts the southeastern edge of the peninsula, and many residents rely on private vehicles, with only the B3, B41, and BM1 bus routes providing transit access. These conditions support neighborhood-oriented retail and service businesses rather than high-foot-traffic destination retail, while the nearby Gateway National Recreation Area and horseback riding academy introduce seasonal recreational demand along the shore. Overall, Georgetown’s commercial profile is modest but stable, framed by long-term residential occupancy and constrained but clearly delineated zones for retail and light industrial uses.
