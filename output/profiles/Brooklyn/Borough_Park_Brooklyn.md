### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A dense, economically diverse Brooklyn neighborhood with a strong Orthodox and Hasidic commercial ecosystem centered on 13th Avenue and other north–south retail corridors serving local and visiting Jewish households.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Global kosher tourism, niche Judaica and technology retail, and kosher hotels draw visitors from other states and countries, supporting a steady flow of out‑of‑area spending in an otherwise neighborhood‑scaled market.


- **THE MARKET:** Thirteenth Avenue’s roughly one‑mile stretch of shops from 39th to 55th Streets and adjacent avenues support kosher food, Judaica, electronics, and hospitality uses, with higher density and a special zoning district adopted in 1992 that permits building on 65% of lots, encouraging continual construction and renovation.

### Around the Block

Borough Park presents itself as a highly specialized commercial environment built around one of the largest Orthodox Jewish communities in the United States. The primary commercial corridor on 13th Avenue, running about a mile from 39th to 55th Streets, is lined with storefronts supplying kosher food, household goods, Judaica, and other items geared to Orthodox and Hasidic consumers. This concentration of retail has long historical roots: by the 1930s, 13th Avenue already hosted pushcart vendors and pickle sellers before the city consolidated some of that activity into a public market on 42nd Street. As demographic change accelerated in the 1980s toward Hasidic families, new shops and restaurants opened on 13th Avenue to serve this expanding market, and by 1983 roughly 85% of residents were Jewish, reinforcing the corridor’s niche orientation.

Commercial operators in Borough Park benefit from both local density and regional demand. The neighborhood’s high birth rate and large household sizes translate into consistent demand for food, apparel, education-related services, and religious goods. Businesses have capitalized on this with Internet sales, especially from the late 1990s onward, shipping electronics and Jewish books, music, and videos to overseas customers. The hospitality sector is tailored to kosher and Shabbat‑observant visitors: the Park House Hotel on 48th Street between 12th and 13th Avenues opened in 1987 as the first kosher hotel in Borough Park, followed by the Avenue Plaza Hotel on 13th Avenue in 1999, the first new hotel in more than a decade. These hotels, along with many area merchants, explicitly accommodate Hasidic tourists, including Israeli expatriates and international visitors. 

Land use and built form respond directly to this demographic and commercial pressure. A 1992 special zoning designation for Borough Park allows building on 65% of a lot, reducing setbacks and backyards and enabling the expansion of building envelopes. A 1998 report noted that since 1990 the Department of Buildings had issued more permits for private construction projects in Borough Park than in any other residential neighborhood in Brooklyn, with much of the work aimed at enlarging interiors. This ongoing cycle of construction and renovation supports contractors, suppliers, and professional services, and indirectly sustains neighborhood retail. Major shopping districts are not limited to 13th Avenue; 16th and 18th Avenues also function as commercial spines, distributing small‑scale retail and services deeper into the grid. Transit access via multiple subway lines and bus routes increases the customer catchment, enabling shoppers from other Brooklyn neighborhoods and beyond to reach these corridors efficiently, and supporting the neighborhood’s role as a regional center for Orthodox consumer and institutional spending.
