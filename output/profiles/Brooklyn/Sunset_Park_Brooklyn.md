## Sunset Park

Sunset Park is a neighborhood in the western part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, bounded by Park Slope and Green-Wood Cemetery to the north, Borough Park to the east, Bay Ridge to the south, and New York Harbor to the west. The neighborhood is named for a public park of the same name that covers 24.5 acres (9.9 ha) between Fifth and Seventh Avenues from 41st to 44th Street. The area north of 36th Street is alternatively known as Greenwood Heights, while the section north of 20th Street is also called South Slope.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Sunset Park combines a substantial historic housing stock with active industrial and commercial zones, particularly along its waterfront and major avenues, supporting light manufacturing, logistics, and neighborhood retail.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Waterfront complexes such as Industry City, Bush Terminal, the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal provide large, flexible commercial and industrial spaces amid historic architecture, while Eighth Avenue’s Chinatown and Fifth Avenue’s Hispanic corridor generate strong neighborhood retail and restaurant activity.


- **THE MARKET:** West of Third Avenue is largely zoned for light industrial use with warehouses, factories, power and waste infrastructure, and marine and freight facilities, while east of Third Avenue low‑rise residential blocks are interspersed with mixed‑use buildings offering ground‑floor commercial space on Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Avenues.

### Around the Block

Sunset Park occupies a key position on Brooklyn’s western waterfront, where legacy maritime and industrial assets are being repurposed for contemporary commerce. The area west of Third Avenue is predominantly light industrial, hosting factories, cargo storage, power generation, solid waste transfer, and large-format warehouse complexes. Industry City, formerly Bush Terminal, stretches between 32nd and 51st Streets, offering roughly 6 million square feet of commercial light manufacturing space, with the northern portion run by a private consortium and the southern segment operated by NYCEDC as a garment manufacturing complex. Just to the south, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, once the world’s largest concrete building complex and a major World War II logistics hub, has been converted by the city into an industrial park that began attracting manufacturing tenants in the 1980s. The South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, an intermodal shipping, warehousing, and manufacturing complex between 29th and 39th Streets, reinforces Sunset Park’s ongoing role in freight and maritime distribution.

Energy and waste infrastructure further underscore the neighborhood’s industrial character. Two major power stations, the Narrows Generating Station at 53rd Street and the Gowanus Generating Station at Third Avenue and 28th Street, anchor high-capacity generation on the waterfront, supplemented by a temporary gas-turbine plant at Third Avenue and 23rd Street. Solid waste facilities include the Hamilton Avenue Marine Transfer Station at 15th Street and Hamilton Avenue, a private transfer station at First Avenue and 50th Street, and a Department of Sanitation garage at First Avenue and 51st Street serving two community districts. These facilities sit alongside rail and marine freight assets, including the 65th Street Yard with car-float bridges linking to New Jersey, and the First Avenue trackage and yard that connect the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Bush Terminal/Industry City, and the MTA’s 36th Street Yard. Multiple expressways, designated truck routes, and NYC Ferry landings at the Brooklyn Army Terminal and near Industry City connect Sunset Park’s working waterfront to the broader regional economy. At street level, commercial corridors on Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Avenues support dense neighborhood retail, restaurants, and services, particularly along Eighth Avenue’s Chinatown and Fifth Avenue’s Hispanic corridor, benefiting from strong transit access via the Fourth Avenue, West End, and Sea Beach subway lines and numerous bus routes.
