### Around the Block

Midwood’s commercial spine is defined by a series of retail corridors that run across the neighborhood, each with its own niche and mix of tenants. Kings Highway is the best‑known corridor, historically home to Dubrow’s Cafeteria and several movie theaters, and today anchored by chain stores, high‑fashion outlets, jewelry stores, sushi restaurants, and other multi‑ethnic retailers. Avenue J and Avenue M function as heavily trafficked business streets with a high concentration of kosher restaurants, delis, pizzerias, butchers, and bakeries, drawing consistent foot traffic from the surrounding community and nearby institutions such as Brooklyn College and multiple yeshivas. Coney Island Avenue between Avenue H and Avenue P layers in additional retail, including the Kent Triplex Movie Theater, Turkish restaurants, a hookah bar, and the United States’ largest kosher supermarket at Avenue L. Nostrand Avenue has transitioned over time from an upscale fashion destination with boutiques like Burton’s and Greenstone’s to a corridor now dominated by automobile showrooms and a U.S. Postal Service facility.

Institutional and cultural uses add further depth to Midwood’s commercial profile. The neighborhood has a long history in film and television production: the Vitagraph Studios, later used by Warner Bros., NBC Brooklyn, and then JC Studios, once supported a local employment base and influenced nearby hospitality businesses such as restaurants that catered to studio staff. Although the studios have since been converted into educational facilities, offices for social services, self‑storage, and ultimately residential uses, the legacy remains part of the area’s identity and helps explain its historic concentration of media‑related activity. Major synagogues, churches, mosques, and yeshivas, including the East Midwood Jewish Center, Kingsway Jewish Center, and numerous Orthodox institutions, sustain steady demand for food, retail, and services across the week and drive strong holiday‑based sales cycles on the kosher corridors. Health‑care institutions such as Mount Sinai Brooklyn and Maimonides Midwood Community Hospital, as well as the nearby SUNY Downstate Medical Center, contribute additional daytime population and employment. The presence of a municipal muni‑meter parking lot near Avenue M and street‑parking initiatives on Kings Highway illustrate how curb management and limited off‑street supply are important considerations for retail operators in this dense, transit‑served neighborhood.
