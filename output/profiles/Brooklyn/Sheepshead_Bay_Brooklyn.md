### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Sheepshead Bay is a largely residential southern Brooklyn neighborhood with active commercial corridors along Emmons Avenue, Sheepshead Bay Road, Avenue U, Ocean Avenue, and Nostrand Avenue, including retail, restaurants, and service businesses.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The bayfront along Emmons Avenue combines maritime zoning, charter and private boat piers, seafood market activity, and Soviet-style restaurants/nightclubs, giving the area a resort-like waterfront entertainment strip rather than a heavy commercial port.


- **THE MARKET:** Waterfront and corridor-oriented retail has seen cycles of reinvestment, with landmarked sites like the former Lundy’s Restaurant converted into shopping center use, rising property values since the 1990s, growing condominium development near the bay, and recurring concerns about loss of parking capacity tied to new projects.

### Around the Block

Sheepshead Bay’s commercial identity is closely tied to its waterfront and transportation history. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the neighborhood emerged as a regional fishing, dining, and tourism destination, catalyzed by Ocean Avenue’s opening and the Long Island Rail Road’s Manhattan Beach Branch. Emmons Avenue developed a high-profile strip dubbed “Millionaire’s Row,” anchored by destination restaurants such as Lundy’s, which helped define the bay as a leisure and hospitality node. While the Sheepshead Bay Race Track and its related racing economy eventually disappeared, the land-use pattern it fostered left a legacy of subdivided sites that later supported denser development and new commercial structures.

The bayfront underwent deliberate planning interventions to shape its commercial direction. City proposals in the 1920s to dredge the channel, build bulkheads, and install dozens of piers raised fears the area would convert into a commercial shipping port. A 1929 compromise limited the waterfront to private and charter boats, and piers on the south side of Emmons Avenue were angled to discourage truck-based freight loading. Subsequent condemnation and rebuilding in the 1930s produced a corridor of "attractive looking restaurants and stores," setting a template for a retail and hospitality-focused waterfront. This maritime zoning vision was reinforced in the 1970s, when a dedicated maritime zoning district on Emmons Avenue was created to promote waterfront-oriented uses rather than heavy industrial shipping.

Over the late 20th century, the commercial landscape cycled through decline and renewal. Lundy’s closure in 1979 led to a downturn in Emmons Avenue retail, and recreational fishing activity waned. However, a 1990s real estate boom brought Lundy’s landmark designation, its reopening, and a wave of new development and tenant interest. By 1996, owners reported doubled real estate prices and rapid absorption of previously vacant units, accompanied by complaints that new projects had eliminated roughly 2,000 parking spaces. The Lundy’s site was ultimately repurposed as a shopping center after its 2007 closure, and the waterfront now supports piers with an active seafood market and tour boats, as well as Soviet-style restaurants and nightclubs that draw patrons from across southern Brooklyn.

Away from the bay, Sheepshead Bay’s commercial activity is distributed along several key arterials. Sheepshead Bay Road, Avenue U, Ocean Avenue, and Nostrand Avenue function as main shopping and business thoroughfares serving both local residents and nearby enclaves such as the Avenue U Chinatown and the Russian- and Central Asian-influenced waterfront community. Transit access via the B and Q trains, multiple local and express bus routes, and proximity to the Shore Parkway and Shore Greenway supports customer inflow and workforce mobility. Emmons Avenue itself forms the west end of the Shore Greenway between Shore Parkway and Jamaica Bay, linking the neighborhood to Canarsie and Cross Bay Boulevard and reinforcing its role as a recreational and leisure corridor with piers offering day-trip fishing and dancing excursions. Overall, the district is best characterized by medium-intensity neighborhood retail and services, hospitality, entertainment, and maritime-oriented businesses rather than large-scale industrial or warehouse operations.
