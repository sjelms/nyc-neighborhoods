### Around the Block

Carroll Gardens presents a compact but commercially active landscape within northwestern Brooklyn, shaped by both its historic institutions and its evolving demographics. The neighborhood’s identity has long been tied to its Italian-American population, which, while diminished as a share of residents, still operates many Italian restaurants and shops and sustains fraternal and benevolent associations connected to specific Italian towns. These operators contribute to a restaurant- and retail-forward streetscape, particularly around the traditional corridors of Court and Smith Streets, and help maintain steady local foot traffic. The Catholic presence, exemplified by churches such as Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and St. Stephen’s, St. Mary’s Star of the Sea, and St. Agnes, also underpins community gathering and periodic processions that bring additional visitors to the area. The 70-year tradition of the Our Lady of Sorrows Good Friday procession and visible religious shrines in front gardens reinforce a street-level culture that supports small-format retail and service businesses.

In the 21st century, a notable influx of French immigrants has added another commercial layer to the neighborhood. French expatriates operate several restaurants and shops, including destinations such as La Cigogne, Café Luluc, Provence en boite, French Louie, Chez Moi, and Bar Tabac, giving rise to the “Little France” or “Little Paris” moniker for Carroll Gardens and its surroundings. This cluster of French-oriented hospitality businesses, combined with the International School of Brooklyn and PS 58’s French dual-language program, attracts families and patrons from beyond the immediate neighborhood, broadening the customer base for local retailers and service providers. Transit access via the F and G trains at Carroll Street and Smith–Ninth Streets stations, together with the B61 and B57 bus routes, integrates the area into broader Brooklyn and Manhattan commuter flows, supporting both daytime and evening commercial activity. At the same time, several historic religious and institutional complexes—such as the South Congregational Church complex and the former Norwegian Seamen’s Church—have been converted to condominium apartments, increasing residential density and purchasing power near long-established commercial blocks. Overall, Carroll Gardens’ combination of stable, high-income households, historic adaptive reuse, and culturally distinct restaurant and retail offerings creates a resilient environment for neighborhood-scale commerce.
