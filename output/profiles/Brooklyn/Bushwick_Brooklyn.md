### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Bushwick is a historically industrial and working-class Brooklyn neighborhood whose commercial activity is concentrated along Knickerbocker, Myrtle, Wyckoff, and Broadway, with significant warehouse and factory stock, some of which has been converted to artist studios, galleries, and live/work lofts.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area’s legacy brewery, chemical, glass, and manufacturing buildings, combined with a strong Hispanic commercial presence and an emerging arts scene in converted warehouses, create opportunities for adaptive reuse and culturally focused retail and entertainment concepts.


- **THE MARKET:** Bushwick’s market is shaped by relatively low median incomes, high rent burden, and ongoing gentrification; older industrial parcels (including the so‑called Industrial Bushwick north of Flushing Avenue) and rezoning plans for higher-density development along Broadway, Myrtle, and Wyckoff Avenues position the neighborhood for continued mixed-use and infill projects.

### Around the Block

Bushwick sits in northern Brooklyn with a long industrial and commercial history that still shapes its streetscape. The neighborhood originally developed around farming and later expanded into breweries, chemical works, glass factories, and other heavy industry tied to nearby waterways such as English Kills. That history is still visible in the industrial swath north of Flushing Avenue, east of Bushwick Avenue, and south of Grand Street, often referred to as East Williamsburg or Industrial Bushwick. Historically, industrial corridors along Flushing Avenue supported brewery-related trades, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, and feed stores, and later attracted Sicilian immigrants who supplied labor for expanding factories. Today, commercial activity is most concentrated on Knickerbocker Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, Wyckoff Avenue, and Broadway, which function as the primary retail and service corridors for the neighborhood’s dense Hispanic population.

Over the last two decades, landlords and developers have targeted Bushwick’s older industrial buildings and multifamily stock for conversion and renovation. Former factories, such as a nut roasting plant, now host creative live/work uses, including a 20-person artist trailer-park collective. Dozens of art studios and galleries are scattered throughout the area, supported by open-studio events and media outlets like Bushwick Daily that promote local culture, food, and nightlife. Nightlife and entertainment venues such as House of Yes, Elsewhere, and astrology-themed LGBTQ-friendly bar Mood Ring leverage the neighborhood’s flexible warehouse footprints and transit access. The Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues complex has been upgraded into a state-of-the-art bus and subway hub, and almost all residents live within a half-mile of subway service, which sustains both local retail and destination venues. At the same time, the Bushwick Initiative and other public programs have explicitly focused on revitalizing the Knickerbocker Avenue commercial district and addressing quality-of-life issues, signaling ongoing public-sector interest in stabilizing and upgrading the business environment. Planned rezonings to allow higher-density development along Broadway and Myrtle and Wyckoff Avenues suggest continued pressure for mixed-use growth, raising both opportunities and challenges for existing small businesses and industrial users.
