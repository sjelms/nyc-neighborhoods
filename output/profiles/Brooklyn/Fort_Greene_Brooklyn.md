### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Fort Greene is a northwestern Brooklyn neighborhood with a strong cultural and institutional presence, anchored by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, and Brooklyn Technical High School, with major commercial activity along Fulton Street, Lafayette Avenue, DeKalb Avenue, and near Atlantic Terminal.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood combines landmarked 19th‑century streetscapes and a large historic district with a long tradition of African-American cultural production, a growing creative sector, and proximity to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Downtown Brooklyn’s office core.


- **THE MARKET:** Fort Greene has undergone significant gentrification and attracts middle- and upper‑income residents and businesses, supported by strong transit access at Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center and DeKalb Avenue, proximity to the Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park arena and mixed‑use development, and adjacency to dense NYCHA campuses that sustain demand for everyday retail and services.

### Around the Block

Fort Greene’s commercial fabric is closely tied to its historic and cultural institutions. The area around the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower forms a key activity node, leveraging foot traffic from performances, educational uses, and nearby high‑density residential buildings. The neighborhood’s main arteries—Fulton Street, Lafayette Avenue, and DeKalb Avenue—function as its primary commercial corridors, supporting ground‑floor retail, food and beverage, and neighborhood services. Atlantic Terminal, which combines the Long Island Rail Road’s Atlantic Terminal station with a major subway hub, brings consistent commuter and visitor flows to the southwest edge of Fort Greene, enhancing demand for destination retail and transit‑oriented commercial uses. The longstanding presence of Brooklyn Technical High School and other educational institutions further concentrates daily population and supports quick‑service offerings and tutoring or educational services.

On the northern fringe, Fort Greene’s boundary at Flushing Avenue is defined in part by the Brooklyn Navy Yard, historically a major employer and industrial center. While the text emphasizes its World War II peak, the Navy Yard’s ongoing role as an employment and production node continues to shape Fort Greene’s broader trade area and its transit connections, including the NYC Ferry stop at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on the Astoria route. Large public-housing complexes—the Fort Greene Houses, later divided into the Walt Whitman Houses and Raymond V. Ingersoll Houses—create substantial year‑round local demand for neighborhood retail, personal services, and community‑oriented uses. The controversial Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park project at the border of Fort Greene and Prospect Heights, including the Barclays Center arena and multiple planned commercial and residential high‑rises, underscores the neighborhood’s strategic location in Brooklyn’s central business and entertainment spine. Extensive subway service, numerous bus routes, and the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway at the northern edge make Fort Greene highly accessible, a key factor behind its ongoing reinvestment, rising incomes, and the layering of cultural, residential, and commercial activity.
