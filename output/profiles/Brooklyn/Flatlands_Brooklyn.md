### Around the Block

Flatlands sits in southeastern Brooklyn and covers just over 2.28 square miles, giving it a substantial footprint for neighborhood-scale commerce. Historically a Dutch farming community known as Nieuw Amersfoort, its early land use was overwhelmingly agricultural, with crops like beans, corn, marsh hay, squash, potato bean, and tobacco grown on large tracts. The proximity to Jamaica Bay made shellfish harvesting and aquaculture an important part of the local economy, with oysters and clams farmed and harvested from surrounding marshes and basins. While the text does not detail current industrial uses, this legacy of productive land and waterfront-related activity underpins a long history of local production and trade. Today, the built environment still includes several 18th-century homesteads and the Flatlands Dutch Reformed Church, indicating pockets of low-rise, historic fabric that coexist with contemporary commercial corridors.

Modern commercial activity in Flatlands is concentrated along several key shopping streets that function as the neighborhood’s primary retail corridors. Utica Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, Avenue N, and Ralph Avenue are identified as the main shopping streets, suggesting continuous ground-floor retail and service uses that draw customers from within Flatlands and from adjacent neighborhoods. Retail is further reinforced by Kings Plaza, a regional indoor mall located just south of Old Mill Basin, at the border area where Flatlands meets Marine Park and Mill Basin; residents commonly shop there, which implies a strong relationship between local street retail and larger-format mall tenants. Although there is no subway service running directly into Flatlands, the neighborhood compensates with extensive bus connectivity, including local and express routes that link to several subway lines. This transit pattern supports worker and shopper circulation to and from the main commercial corridors and to Kings Plaza, maintaining accessibility even without in-neighborhood subway stations. With a 2010 population of 64,762 and a relatively high population density, the area offers a sizable customer base for neighborhood-serving retail and services, creating steady demand along its established avenues.
