## Navy Yard

The Brooklyn Navy Yard (originally known as the New York Navy Yard ) is a shipyard and industrial complex in northwest Brooklyn in New York City, New York, U.S. The Navy Yard is located on the East River in Wallabout Bay, a semicircular bend of the river across from Corlears Hook in Manhattan. It is bounded by Navy Street to the west, Flushing Avenue to the south, Kent Avenue to the east, and the East River on the north. The site, which covers 225.15 acres (91.11 ha), is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A secure, city-run industrial and commercial campus on the East River with active ship repair, soundstages, light manufacturing, office space, and modern vertical-manufacturing buildings, all within a historic former naval shipyard.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Extensive historic infrastructure—dry docks, warehouses, and landmark structures—repurposed for film production, advanced manufacturing, technology research, rooftop urban farming, and a growing food and beverage presence including a supermarket and distillery.


- **THE MARKET:** The yard is almost fully leased with over 330 businesses, roughly 7,000 workers, and ongoing multi-billion-dollar capital plans that add millions of square feet of manufacturing, office, and retail space, positioning the complex as a major waterfront employment and innovation hub rather than a residential market.

### Around the Block

The Brooklyn Navy Yard functions as a large-scale industrial and commercial enclave rather than a traditional mixed-use neighborhood. Once a major U.S. Navy shipyard, it has been transformed into a city-owned industrial park that concentrates manufacturing, logistics, ship repair, media production, and emerging technology firms. The site’s advantages are deeply tied to its waterfront setting on Wallabout Bay and the East River, where it retains working piers and six dry docks. Three of these docks remain in active service under GMD Shipyard Corp, supporting marine maintenance and related industrial tenants. Inside the walls, legacy industrial buildings—like the early reinforced-concrete supply storehouse (Building 3) and massive WWII-era Building 77—have been modernized for light manufacturing, storage, offices, and specialized uses like radio labs, research spaces, and rooftop agriculture.

In recent decades, the Navy Yard has attracted a diverse tenant mix that includes Seatrain’s former heavy shipbuilding footprint, ongoing ship repair uses, and a strong concentration of creative and media industries. Steiner Studios, opened in 2004, has grown into one of the largest production studios in the U.S. outside Hollywood, anchoring a cluster of film- and media-related activity and spurring plans for a broader media campus at the former Naval Hospital site. Newlab and the Green Manufacturing Center in Building 128 support technology and advanced manufacturing firms, while the Research Yard initiative led by Pratt Institute in Building 3 further deepens the innovation ecosystem. Adaptive reuse continues along the perimeter: the Admiral’s Row site now includes 399 Sands Street, a Wegmans supermarket, structured parking, and additional light industrial and office space, enhancing on-site retail and employee amenities. The yard’s energy needs are supported by a modern cogeneration plant at Building 41 and a large rooftop solar installation on Building 293, which is also slated to become a major events and nightclub venue.

Commercial activity is reinforced by improving access and circulation tailored to tenants. While the internal street grid is privately maintained and not shown on city maps, multiple controlled gates at Sands/Navy Streets, Cumberland/Flushing, Clinton/Flushing, and Kent/Clymer allow truck and employee access from surrounding districts such as Vinegar Hill, Fort Greene, Farragut Houses, Wallabout, and Williamsburg. Transit connections have been layered on to serve the employment base: the B67 bus operates inside the yard and additional bus routes run along its edges, while NYC Ferry’s Dock 72 stop and homeport operations integrate fast commuter and maritime logistics access. Complementary tenant-only shuttle buses connect the yard directly to major subway and LIRR nodes at Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center and Atlantic Terminal, as well as nearby F, A/C, and G stations. With an updated master plan calling for another 5.1 million square feet of primarily manufacturing space and vertical industrial buildings, the Brooklyn Navy Yard is being positioned as a long-term, high-density employment zone linking historic maritime infrastructure with contemporary production, research, and creative industries.
