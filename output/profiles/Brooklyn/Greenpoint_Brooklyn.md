### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Greenpoint is a historically industrial, working-class Brooklyn waterfront neighborhood with a mix of legacy manufacturing, maritime uses, and increasingly intensive residential development following a 2005 rezoning.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** A substantial Polish commercial presence along corridors like Manhattan Avenue, combined with historic industrial architecture and film/TV production facilities, has created a distinctive mix of Little Poland retail, cultural institutions, and creative-industry uses.


- **THE MARKET:** Rezoning has shifted significant waterfront and upland parcels from low-rise industrial to higher-density residential and mixed-use, adding new condominiums, large waterfront projects such as Greenpoint Landing, and an estimated 250,000 square feet of new retail at the expense of over 1,000,000 square feet of industrial capacity.

### Around the Block

Greenpoint’s commercial identity is deeply rooted in its 19th‑century industrialization, when it emerged as a major manufacturing district for shipbuilding, glass, porcelain, oil refining, and related trades along the East River and Newtown Creek. Rope factories, lumber yards and maritime facilities lined the waterfront, while brass and iron foundries, breweries, drug plants, and machine shops filled out the inland blocks. The Greenpoint Wood Exchange and major operations like Union Porcelain Works and Charles Pratt’s Astral Oil Works anchored a dense employment base that drew successive waves of German, Irish, and especially Polish workers. Today many of the original industrial buildings and worker housing survive in the Greenpoint Historic District, and former factories such as the Eberhard Faber pencil complex have been adaptively reused, in some cases for creative offices like Kickstarter’s headquarters. These historic structures, alongside religious and civic landmarks, provide a distinctive building stock that continues to attract film and television producers, who use local warehouses and mixed-use blocks as soundstages and backdrops.

Twentieth- and twenty‑first‑century shifts have rebalanced Greenpoint’s land use from heavy industry to a more mixed commercial, creative, and residential program. Manufacturing declined after World War II, with lingering environmental legacies including the large Greenpoint oil spill and issues around waste transfer stations and sewage treatment; activism and litigation have targeted cleanup and pollution controls, particularly in the commercial/industrial eastern section near the East Williamsburg Industrial Park. The 2005 rezoning of 175 blocks in Greenpoint and Williamsburg accelerated change, trading over a million square feet of industrial capacity for housing and an expected 250,000 square feet of new retail, plus a 28‑acre waterfront park and a continuous East River promenade. Large-scale projects such as Greenpoint Landing—ten residential towers with integrated school and park space—illustrate the scale of new investment. At the same time, the neighborhood’s Polish commercial strip, independent shops, and service businesses remain active, and film and TV stage companies like Broadway Stages and CineMagic Studios maintain extensive facilities in the industrial area between Greenpoint Avenue and Norman Avenue east of McGuinness Boulevard. Transit links via the G subway, multiple bus routes, and East River Ferry service support both workforce access and the growing role of Greenpoint as a production, nightlife, and mixed-use waterfront destination.
