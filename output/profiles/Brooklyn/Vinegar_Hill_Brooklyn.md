## Vinegar Hill

Vinegar Hill is a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City on the East River Waterfront between Dumbo and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The neighborhood is locally governed by Brooklyn Community Board 2 and is policed by the New York City Police Department 's 84th Precinct. The large Irish-American population in Vinegar Hill made it one of several New York City neighborhoods once known colloquially as Irishtown.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A compact East River waterfront enclave with historic 19th‑century building stock, mixed light industrial and residential uses, and proximity to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and DUMBO.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Belgian block streets, landmarked historic housing, and legacy utility infrastructure like the Con Edison Hudson Avenue Generating Station create a distinct, low‑scale environment adjacent to major industrial and creative employment centers.


- **THE MARKET:** Former warehouses and a historic firehouse have been converted into lofts and office space since the early 2000s, while small destination restaurants on Hudson Avenue signal limited but notable retail and hospitality demand in an otherwise quiet commercial setting.

### Around the Block

Vinegar Hill occupies a small but strategically located stretch of Brooklyn’s East River waterfront between DUMBO and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, giving it a commercial profile that blends industrial legacy with emerging creative and service uses. The neighborhood historically developed around maritime and shipbuilding activity, particularly after John Jackson established a shipyard near Wallabout Bay in the late 18th century and subsequently sold land for the creation of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This waterfront industrial orientation was reinforced in the 1920s with the construction of a large power plant on the East River by Consolidated Edison, now the Con Edison Hudson Avenue Generating Station, which still anchors the area even as debate continues about potential future reuse. The neighborhood’s proximity to the Navy Yard made it a natural residential base for shipyard and Navy Yard workers, but it also ensured steady industrial and warehouse activity around the yard’s perimeter.

Over time, Vinegar Hill saw significant industrial growth that replaced many earlier houses with factories and warehouses, particularly around the era of the Manhattan Bridge construction and into the mid‑20th century. The shutdown of the Navy Yard in 1966 signaled a broader shift in New York’s economy away from heavy industry, and Vinegar Hill’s relationship to the waterfront economy weakened. Beginning in the 1970s, however, an ethnically diverse wave of newcomers, including many artists, was attracted by the neighborhood’s river views and its close proximity to Manhattan. This helped preserve the Belgian block streets on Hudson Avenue and nearby corridors, and supported the case for landmarking; the city ultimately designated the Vinegar Hill Historic District in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, a number of buildings originally developed as warehouses have been converted into lofts or office spaces, reflecting the broader pattern of industrial‑to‑creative reuse seen in nearby DUMBO and along the Navy Yard fringe. A former firehouse at 227 Front Street was repurposed as a loft building, and new food and beverage tenants have appeared, including Vinegar Hill House at 72 Hudson Avenue and Café Gitane at 70 Hudson Avenue, adding boutique dining to an otherwise low‑intensity commercial mix. Overall, Vinegar Hill offers a quiet, small‑scale environment with historic architecture and longstanding infrastructure, positioned between major employment and innovation hubs while still retaining pockets of underutilized industrial and utility property that may be candidates for future adaptive reuse.
