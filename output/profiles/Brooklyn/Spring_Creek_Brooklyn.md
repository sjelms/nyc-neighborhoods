## Spring Creek

Spring Creek, previously called Spring Creek Basin, is a neighborhood within the East New York section of Brooklyn in New York City. It roughly comprises the southern portions of East New York between Flatlands Avenue to the north, and Jamaica Bay and the Gateway National Recreation Area to the south, with the Brooklyn neighborhood of Canarsie to the west and the Queens neighborhood of Howard Beach to the east. It is named after Spring Creek, one of several creeks that formerly ran through the area and drained into Jamaica Bay.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Spring Creek is a largely planned, auto‑oriented section of East New York with major retail at Gateway Center, large institutional uses, and extensive public housing and infrastructure facilities on formerly industrial and landfill lands.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area combines big‑box shopping, postal and transit depots, and water pollution control plants with expansive new parkland on reclaimed landfills, including Shirley Chisholm State Park and Spring Creek Park along Jamaica Bay.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated in suburban‑style shopping centers, industrial parks, sanitation and transit yards, and ground‑floor retail in new affordable housing, with significant land tied up in public facilities and long‑term urban renewal projects.

### Around the Block

Spring Creek’s commercial footprint is defined by a mix of large-format retail, industrial utilities, and major public facilities woven into an urban renewal landscape. The Gateway Center shopping complex on Erskine Street and Gateway Drive is the signature retail destination, developed as the commercial component of the Gateway Estates plan on former landfill sites south of Flatlands Avenue. Its two-phase, suburban-style configuration (Gateway Center and Gateway Center II) positions big-box and national retailers at the edge of major arterial roads, capturing shoppers from across southeastern Brooklyn and adjacent Queens. Within Starrett City, the Spring Creek Towers Shopping Center serves the vast subsidized apartment complex and anchors a steady stream of neighborhood spending power. North of Flatlands Avenue, the Flatlands Fairfield Industrial Park adds another node of employment and light industrial or distribution activity to the broader East New York industrial belt.

Public infrastructure and logistics are unusually prominent drivers of land use and employment in Spring Creek. In the former Plunders Neck area east of Fountain Avenue and south of Linden Boulevard, the United States Postal Service operates the large Brooklyn Processing and Distribution Center at 1050 Forbell Street, a major mail hub sandwiched between a Department of Sanitation garage and the Spring Creek Depot bus facility run by MTA Bus Company. This cluster is complemented by multiple Department of Sanitation operations, including the Spring Creek Yard Waste Composting Facility on the old South Shore Incinerator site and additional DSNY garages near Milford Street and Georgia Avenue, giving the neighborhood an outsized role in citywide sanitation logistics. Water treatment infrastructure is also significant, with the Spring Creek Auxiliary Water Pollution Control Plant and the 26th Ward Water Pollution Control Plant on Hendrix Creek underscoring the area’s long-standing role in utility functions. Together with bus depots, postal processing, and industrial parks, these facilities create a strong base of blue‑collar and operations employment, while the nearby Jamaica Bay shoreline and newly restored parklands soften the image of a district historically associated with landfills and incinerators.

Spring Creek’s newer housing-led projects also embed commercial uses that support local street-level activity. Gateway Elton Street, a three-phase affordable housing development on Elton Street between Flatlands Avenue and the Gateway Center, includes six-story apartment buildings with retail at grade, integrating neighborhood-serving shops into the residential fabric adjacent to the mall. The Nehemiah Spring Creek rowhouse community, while primarily residential, sits immediately north of Gateway Center II, feeding additional demand for services and everyday retail. Educational and athletic facilities like the Spring Creek Educational Campus and the Moe Finklestein Athletic Complex bring daytime populations of students and staff, adding to the customer base for nearby businesses. Overall, Spring Creek functions as a hybrid district where large-scale retail, public infrastructure, and industrial operations coexist with extensive affordable housing and newly reclaimed open space, tied together by bus-oriented connectivity rather than direct rail access.
