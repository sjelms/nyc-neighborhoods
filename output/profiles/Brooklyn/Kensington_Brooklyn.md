### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Kensington is a centrally located Brooklyn neighborhood with its main commercial activity concentrated along Coney Island Avenue, Church Avenue, Ditmas Avenue, and McDonald Avenue, with Ocean Parkway as a major organizing spine.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Pre-war brick apartment buildings, many operating as co-ops along Ocean Parkway and Coney Island Avenue, provide a substantial multifamily housing stock that has attracted successive waves of diverse communities and supported stable local retail.


- **THE MARKET:** The area has a long history of rezoning and mid- to high-rise elevator apartment construction along Ocean Parkway, with hybrid commercial/walk-up mixed-use buildings on the commercial thoroughfares and continued residential infill since the 1990s.

### Around the Block

Kensington sits in central Brooklyn just south of Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery, with Ocean Parkway physically bisecting the neighborhood and structuring much of its building pattern and traffic flow. The commercial spine runs primarily along Coney Island Avenue, Church Avenue, Ditmas Avenue, and McDonald Avenue, where hybrid commercial and walk-up apartment structures cluster to serve a dense and varied local population. These corridors historically developed alongside the completion of Ocean Parkway and Coney Island Avenue in the late 19th century, when developers began promoting detached suburban villas and townhouse rows that drew wealthier residents out from more urbanized Brooklyn neighborhoods. Over time, these early villas along upper Ocean Parkway were systematically replaced by six‑story elevator apartment houses between the late 1920s and early 1940s, followed by even taller luxury buildings after the development of the Prospect Expressway. This evolution established a multifamily corridor that continues to anchor demand for neighborhood-serving retail and professional services at street level.

The subarea known as Parkville, in the southern part of Kensington between 18th and Foster Avenues, features a distinctive slightly diagonal street grid that adds corner exposure and varied lot shapes to the built environment, encouraging smaller-scale storefronts and institutional uses such as churches and schools. Kensington’s ethnic mix—including South Asian, Orthodox Jewish, Uzbek, Latin American, Polish, and Ukrainian communities—has translated into a broad range of neighborhood businesses, with the co-naming of the McDonald and Church Avenues intersection as Little Bangladesh signaling the prominence of South Asian commercial activity there. Transit has played a persistent role in shaping commercial viability: the IND Culver Line runs along the western edge, with underground stations at Fort Hamilton Parkway and Church Avenue and elevated stations at Ditmas Avenue and 18th Avenue, funneling riders directly into the commercial streets. Historical changes in transit, such as the mid‑20th‑century closure of the Church Avenue streetcar and subsequent bus service expansion, have periodically reconfigured how customers reach local businesses. Today, multiple local and express bus routes, together with the subway, support a walkable, transit-oriented commercial landscape embedded within a largely residential context.
