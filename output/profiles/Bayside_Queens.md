### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A largely residential Queens neighborhood of free-standing homes with relatively high population density and a reputation as one of the more expensive housing markets in the city for comparable detached houses.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its combination of suburban-style housing near the water and longstanding status as a safe, relatively affluent community that once attracted entertainers and movie stars.


- **THE MARKET:** Dominated by free-standing single-family homes, with high prices for detached houses and additional stock in co-op and condo developments, particularly in areas like Bay Terrace.
