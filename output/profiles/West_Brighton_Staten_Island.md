### Around the Block

West New Brighton, also called West Brighton, occupies a strategic position on Staten Island’s North Shore with direct access to the Kill Van Kull waterfront. Richmond Terrace forms the main commercial and vehicular spine along this edge and remains home to several shipyards and tugboat companies, underscoring the neighborhood’s long-standing maritime and industrial functions. The waterfront orientation historically tied the area to shipyard and defense work, which is reflected in the Markham Homes public housing development, originally constructed to house families of shipyard and defense workers. Although postwar redevelopment and later tenant relocations changed the residential profile, the legacy of manufacturing and marine logistics still underpins a portion of local employment and land use. Forest Avenue, where small food and specialty shops operate, complements the waterfront industrial strip with neighborhood-serving retail and service establishments that benefit from the area’s density. 

Institutional and recreational anchors add a second commercial and employment layer to West New Brighton. The Staten Island Zoo and nearby parks such as Clove Lakes Park and Silver Lake Park function as regional attractions that bring visitor traffic to the neighborhood, supporting secondary retail and service opportunities. Richmond University Medical Center, housed largely in buildings from the late 1960s onward, is a major healthcare institution providing steady professional employment and day‑time population, with the historic Garner Mansion on campus signaling the area’s layered built environment. Cultural and educational nodes in adjacent Livingston, including Snug Harbor’s children’s museum, botanical gardens, and arts facilities, expand the catchment of visitors moving through West New Brighton’s commercial corridors. Transit connectivity is entirely bus-based, with multiple local routes (S40, S44, S46, S48, S53, S54, S90, S94, S96, S98) and the SIM30 express bus linking the neighborhood to the rest of Staten Island and Manhattan, which is important for both workforce access and customer flow. Although rail service on the North Shore Branch ended in 1953, the extensive bus network and arterial routes like Richmond Terrace and Broadway continue to sustain the area’s blend of maritime industry, institutional campuses, and neighborhood retail.
