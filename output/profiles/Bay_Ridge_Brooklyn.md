Bay Ridge is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by Sunset Park to the north, Dyker Heights to the east, the Narrows and the Belt Parkway to the west, and Fort Hamilton Army Base and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the south.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A largely residential southwest Brooklyn neighborhood with a mix of apartment buildings and one- and two-family homes, anchored by Shore Road parks and views of New York Harbor.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its relatively secluded, small-town feel and waterfront green space despite being at the edge of the city.


- **THE MARKET:** Housing consists mainly of prewar and postwar apartment buildings, attached row houses, and smaller homes, generally more affordable than many Brownstone and North Brooklyn neighborhoods.

### Around the Block

Bay Ridge is a southwest Brooklyn neighborhood overlooking the Narrows, with tree-lined streets, low- to mid-rise housing, and a commercial spine along Third and Fifth Avenues. It blends long-established communities with newer immigrant populations and has a quieter, residential character compared to more central Brooklyn areas.
