## Bay Ridge

Bay Ridge is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the New York City borough of Brooklyn . It is bounded by Sunset Park to the north, Dyker Heights to the east, the Narrows and the Belt Parkway to the west, and Fort Hamilton Army Base and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the south. The section of Bay Ridge south of 86th Street is sometimes considered part of a sub-neighborhood called Fort Hamilton.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Bay Ridge is a dense southwest Brooklyn neighborhood with long-established commercial corridors along Third and Fifth Avenues, lined with ethnic restaurants, local retail, and service businesses that serve a large and diverse population.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its built-out character and mid-rise apartment stock, Bay Ridge offers waterfront access via Shore Road Park and the American Veterans Memorial Pier, a ferry connection, and proximity to Fort Hamilton Army Base, which brings a steady employment and institutional presence.


- **THE MARKET:** Historically residential with six-story apartment complexes along Shore Road and successive waves of redevelopment replacing smaller homes with condominiums, Bay Ridge’s commercial real estate benefits from high population density, strong household incomes, and stable foot traffic on its main retail avenues.

### Around the Block

Bay Ridge occupies the southwest corner of Brooklyn, where dense housing meets active commercial corridors and significant regional infrastructure. Third and Fifth Avenues function as the neighborhood’s primary commercial spines, hosting many ethnic restaurants and small businesses that reflect Bay Ridge’s Norwegian, Irish, Italian, Arab, and broader immigrant communities. This mix of food, retail, and services supports a local customer base that has grown substantially, with the population rising to over 110,000 residents and a high median household income. The area’s long history of speculative building and multifamily development is visible in the apartment houses that replaced earlier estates and country homes, as well as in the six-story complexes lining Shore Road. More recently, many older two-family houses were demolished in the 1990s and 2000s and replaced by condominiums, locally dubbed “Fedder Homes,” signaling a continued, incremental intensification of the built environment.

Waterfront access plays a notable role in Bay Ridge’s commercial and logistical profile. The American Veterans Memorial Pier at Bay Ridge Avenue and Shore Road, historically a ferry terminal, now hosts NYC Ferry’s South Brooklyn route, connecting the neighborhood to Wall Street and other western Brooklyn nodes. This ferry service complements the Belt Parkway and Gowanus Expressway, which encircle the area and provide vehicular access for commuters and goods movement. Fort Hamilton Army Base, at the neighborhood’s southern edge, anchors a federal institutional presence and brings associated support services, including the Harbor Defense Museum as a cultural draw. While heavy industrial uses are concentrated north of present-day Bay Ridge—including legacy waterfront complexes like Bush Terminal (now Industry City)—the freight-only Bay Ridge Branch still links car floats to the Long Island Rail Road, underscoring the corridor’s continued rail-freight relevance. Together with the R train subway service and extensive local and express bus coverage, these transit and roadway assets position Bay Ridge as a well-connected urban node where neighborhood-serving commerce, institutional users, and residential density reinforce one another.
