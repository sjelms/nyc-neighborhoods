### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Bay Ridge’s commercial activity is concentrated along Third and Fifth Avenues, which function as the primary retail corridors with a mix of ethnic restaurants, local services, and small businesses serving a sizable and diverse population.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Waterfront amenities such as the American Veterans Memorial Pier (69th Street Pier), Shore Road Park, and ferry service on the NYC Ferry South Brooklyn route add recreational and commuter appeal, while Fort Hamilton Army Base brings a unique federal institutional presence and related support uses.


- **THE MARKET:** Historically low- to mid-rise, the area has seen replacement of older two-family structures with condominiums, some mid-rise apartment buildings along Shore Road, and stable neighborhood retail strips, supported by strong transit access via the R subway line, multiple local and express buses, and proximity to the Belt Parkway and Gowanus Expressway.
