### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Gravesend is a south-central Brooklyn neighborhood with a mix of local retail strips, public institutions, and auto-oriented big-box uses near major arterials and the Belt Parkway.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its waterfront-adjacent subsections such as White Sands have attracted large-format retail like Home Depot, leveraging proximity to Shore Parkway and Cropsey Avenue for high vehicular access.


- **THE MARKET:** Historically developed as a resort and later as a working- and middle-class residential area, Gravesend today includes public housing at Marlboro Houses, upscale single-family redevelopment in the northeast section, and stable neighborhood retail, with some conversion and reinvestment activity since the 1990s.

### Around the Block

Gravesend occupies a strategically located swath of south-central Brooklyn, framed by the Belt/Shore Parkway and several major north–south arterials that have long influenced its commercial and logistical profile. The neighborhood’s southern edge along Coney Island Creek and Shore Parkway positions it close to Gravesend Bay and the broader Coney Island waterfront, historically tying the area into resort, racing, and amusement-oriented commerce linked to nearby racetracks and Coney Island attractions. Though much of that resort-era economy faded with the closure of the great racetracks in the early 20th century, the legacy remains visible in the form of stable, rail- and road-served corridors and the nearby Coney Island Subway Yard, which anchors significant transit infrastructure in the immediate area. The presence of Calvert Vaux Park to the southwest and the long-standing grid anchored by McDonald Avenue and Gravesend Neck Road add to the area’s recognizable, planned layout, which can be advantageous for small-scale neighborhood retail and service uses along key intersections. 

Modern Gravesend is characterized by a combination of public and private capital investments. The Marlboro Houses, a 28-building NYCHA complex between Avenues V and X and Stillwell Avenue and the Gravesend subway yards, form a large, concentrated residential customer base that supports local ground-floor retail and services on surrounding streets. In the White Sands section between Shore Parkway and Coney Island Creek, the conversion of former low-rise bungalows into a major Home Depot store by 2002 reflects a shift toward auto-oriented, destination retail driven by proximity to Shore Parkway and high-traffic Cropsey Avenue. Northeast Gravesend, bounded by McDonald Avenue, Kings Highway, Ocean Parkway, and Avenue U, has seen the development of large, upscale single-family homes associated with an affluent Sephardic Jewish community, which in turn supports specialty retail, education, and religious institutional uses. Three subway corridors—the BMT West End, IND Culver, and BMT Sea Beach lines—provide strong multi-line access, connecting Gravesend’s workforce and customer base to the rest of Brooklyn and Manhattan, while a cluster of bus routes further strengthens east–west and north–south links. Together, the mix of transit infrastructure, major roads, and evolving housing stock underpin a diverse, largely neighborhood-serving commercial environment with pockets of regional draw.
