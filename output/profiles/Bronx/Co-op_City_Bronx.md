## Co-op City

Co-op City (short for Cooperative City ) is a cooperative housing development located in the northeast section of the borough of the Bronx in New York City. It is bounded by Interstate 95 to the southwest, west, and north and the Hutchinson River Parkway to the east and southeast, and is partially in the Baychester and Eastchester neighborhoods. With 43,752 residents as of the 2010 United States census, it is the largest housing cooperative in the world. It is in New York City Council District 12.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Co-op City is a massive master-planned cooperative complex in northeast Bronx, functioning as a self-contained node with three shopping centers, numerous professional offices, and proximity to the adjacent Bay Plaza Shopping Center.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its scale and density, only about 20% of the 320-acre site is developed, leaving substantial green space, recreation areas, and waterfront athletic fields that buffer the commercial and institutional uses.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated in on-site shopping centers, medical and professional office space, and nearby Bay Plaza, with additional potential tied to a remaining C7 amusement-park zoning lot at Bartow and Baychester Avenues and evolving energy and infrastructure investments.

### Around the Block

Co-op City presents itself as a purpose-built urban enclave with a strong internal commercial ecosystem anchored by multiple shopping centers and institutional facilities. Designed as a “city within a city,” it integrates three shopping centers and more than 40 professional offices into a dense residential superblock, ensuring steady foot traffic for ground-floor retail and service providers. The adjacent Bay Plaza Shopping Center further reinforces the area’s role as a retail draw, offering a 13-screen multiplex, department stores, and a supermarket, and functioning as a major consumer destination for the northeast Bronx. Within the complex, eight parking garages and large interim surface lots (created when garages were closed for repairs) underline a heavy dependence on structured and on-grade parking to support both resident and shopper access. Medical, legal, and other professional tenants occupy distributed office space, adding a daytime commercial population and reinforcing Co-op City’s role as a service hub for the surrounding neighborhoods.

Historically, Co-op City sits on land that transitioned from marshland to a large theme park (Freedomland U.S.A.) and then to its current high-density, mixed-use character. A small portion of the former park site at Bartow and Baychester Avenues retains C7 zoning, legally reserved for large amusement parks; this anomaly recently drew commercial attention as the lot’s flexible sign-height rules supported the installation of tall LED billboards and, briefly, a wind turbine. Residents pushed for rezoning toward standard commercial use, signaling local sensitivity to signage, nighttime light impacts, and the evolution of permitted uses. The community also operates its own large power plant, which has been upgraded toward a 40-megawatt tri-generation facility, positioning the complex as an energy producer that can sell surplus power back to the grid and reduce operating costs. Extensive capital programs to rehabilitate garages, roofs, facades, and infrastructure demonstrate an ongoing reinvestment cycle that matters for long-term asset performance and reliability. Major greenways, ballfields along the Hutchinson River, and the nearby draw of Pelham Bay Park, Orchard Beach, and City Island enhance the area’s livability and recreational appeal, in turn sustaining demand for local retail and services.
