## Throgs Neck

Throggs Neck (also known as Throgs Neck ) is a neighborhood and peninsula in the south-eastern portion of the borough of the Bronx in New York City. It is bounded by the East River and Long Island Sound to the south and east, Westchester Creek on the west, and Baisley Avenue and the Bruckner Expressway on the north.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Throgs Neck is a southeastern Bronx peninsula neighborhood with strong highway connectivity via the Throgs Neck and Bronx–Whitestone Bridges and the nearby Bruckner Interchange, supporting regional access for local commerce and services.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Large waterfront parks, a golf course, beach clubs and a waterfront restaurant coexist with major bridge approaches and expressways, creating a mix of recreational and transportation-oriented uses unusual for a dense New York City neighborhood.


- **THE MARKET:** The area contains a mix of middle- and upper-middle-income households, up-market waterfront condominiums, and some low-income public housing, with historically strong demand for waterfront units and a relatively stable income profile within Community District 10.

### Around the Block

Throgs Neck occupies a strategic position at the southeastern edge of the Bronx, where the East River meets Long Island Sound, and where two major toll bridges link the borough to Queens and Long Island. The neighborhood hosts the northern approaches of both the Throgs Neck Bridge and the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, giving it outsized importance in the regional transportation network. This location is reinforced by proximity to the Bruckner Interchange, where the Hutchinson River Parkway, the Bruckner Expressway, the Hutchinson River Expressway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Throgs Neck Expressway, and the New England Thruway all converge. For commercial users and service businesses, these linkages translate into efficient vehicle access to multiple boroughs and suburban markets, a core strength of the area. 

Waterfront land uses are prominent, with Ferry Point Park split by the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge into an active recreation side and a larger east side that includes a promenade, a golf course, and a waterfront restaurant. The presence of an NYC Ferry stop at Ferry Point Park further enhances connectivity, adding a passenger maritime link to the transit mix and supporting visitation to local recreational and hospitality uses. Historically, Throgs Neck’s shoreline supported steamboat landings and beer gardens that attracted visitors from other parts of the city, illustrating the long-standing commercial potential of its waterfront. Institutional uses are also significant, most notably the State University of New York Maritime College campus at the former Fort Schuyler, which brings academic and maritime training activity to the peninsula. 

The neighborhood’s physical fabric reflects a gradual evolution from large farms and private estates to denser, platted communities, including bungalow colonies such as Silver Beach Garden and nearby Edgewater Park that were adapted from seasonal to year-round use. While the text emphasizes residential stock, the commercial profile is shaped by local retail along major corridors like East Tremont Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, as indicated by bus routes and public facilities located on those streets. Public services including NYPD’s 45th Precinct, FDNY engine and ladder companies, and a United States Postal Service station on East Tremont Avenue create steady institutional employment and daily foot traffic. Overall, the area combines strong vehicular and ferry access, recreational waterfront amenities, and educational and civic anchors, creating a stable environment for neighborhood-serving retail, food-and-beverage, and service-oriented commercial uses that benefit from regional connectivity yet operate in a lower-density, peninsula setting.
