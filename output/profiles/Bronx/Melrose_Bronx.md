### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Melrose is a South Bronx neighborhood with high-density residential stock, significant public housing concentrations, and proximity to the major commercial hub known as The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Recent decades have brought substantial reinvestment, including LEED-certified and Passive House developments such as Via Verde and Park Avenue Green, positioning Melrose as a locus for green, energy-efficient multifamily construction in the Bronx.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is centered around Melrose Avenue, Third Avenue, and especially the nearby Hub–Third Avenue BID, one of the Bronx’s largest shopping areas, with strong pedestrian traffic supported by multiple bus routes, subway connections on the 2 and 5 lines, and a local Metro-North station.

### Around the Block

Melrose sits in the southwestern Bronx as a compact, high-density neighborhood that has long been tied to working-class and immigrant economies. Historically, the area was a village in the town of Morrisania and later became a dense working-class enclave where quick-turn housing development accommodated migrants leaving Manhattan. That same rapid construction and subsequent disinvestment, combined with citywide fiscal crisis and arson in the 1960s and 1970s, left much of the original building stock damaged or razed, creating a landscape of vacant buildings and lots by the 1980s. The removal of the Third Avenue El in 1973 also reduced rail access that had been an initial draw. Yet its location next to the business and former theater area known as The Hub ensured that Melrose remained strategically positioned within the broader South Bronx commercial map.

Since the mid-1990s, and especially throughout the 2000s, Melrose has undergone significant renewal with a clear physical and economic shift visible on its main corridors. The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District, at the convergence of East 149th Street, Westchester, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues, is now one of the Bronx’s largest retail concentrations, second only to Fordham Road. This district benefits from frequent bus service, including routes along 149th Street, Grand Concourse, Webster Avenue, Third Avenue and Westchester Avenue, as well as the 2 and 5 subway lines at Third Avenue–149th Street. The Metro-North Melrose station on the Harlem Line adds a regional rail layer, though local stakeholders have pressed for more frequent service and a reopened entrance to East 161st Street to better connect directly into the commercial spine. New green multifamily developments such as Via Verde and Park Avenue Green indicate sustained investment in energy-efficient, high-density housing nearby, supporting local retail demand. Institutions like Boricua College, historic churches, NYCHA campuses, and fire and EMS facilities further anchor the area, creating steady daily foot traffic that underpins the surrounding small-business and BID-oriented retail environment.

While Melrose is still characterized socioeconomically as part of the South Bronx, with low median incomes and a high rent-burdened population, the concentration of redevelopment sites and remaining city-owned parcels suggests ongoing construction activity and demographic growth. Groups such as Nos Quedamos have played a prominent role in guiding rebuilding and infill, and many parcels remain in various stages of development. This combination of dense public housing, new green residential projects, anchor institutions, and a major retail BID makes Melrose a neighborhood where commercial opportunities are tightly linked to residential needs and transit-dependent shoppers. The street grid defined by Melrose Avenue, Third Avenue, and cross streets like East 149th and East 161st allows for continuous retail frontage, while proximity to The Hub positions the area as both a local service center and a feeder market into one of the Bronx’s primary shopping destinations.
