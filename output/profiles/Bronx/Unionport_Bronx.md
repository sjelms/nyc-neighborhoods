### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Unionport, as a subsection of Castle Hill north of Lafayette Avenue, shares Castle Hill’s primarily residential land use but benefits from access to the neighborhood’s main commercial corridors along White Plains Road, Castle Hill Avenue, and Westchester Avenue.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area’s commercial strips are supported by an established business improvement district on Castle Hill Avenue and proximity to the Shops at Bruckner Commons, which houses national chain retailers and serves as a regional shopping draw.


- **THE MARKET:** Most new construction in the broader neighborhood consists of modern multi-unit buildings, many multi-zoned for retail with mixed-income housing above, while the eastern edge along Westchester Creek accommodates storage, warehousing, and municipal uses, signaling ongoing mixed-use and service-oriented commercial demand.

### Around the Block

Unionport sits within the northern portion of Castle Hill, a southeastern Bronx neighborhood whose commercial and physical character has been shaped by transit, postwar development, and gradual infill. While the land use is described as primarily residential, commerce is strongly concentrated along White Plains Road, Castle Hill Avenue, and Westchester Avenue, which function as the core retail and service corridors for the area. These corridors host a full range of neighborhood-serving businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, barbershops, hair salons, fast food outlets, bodegas, and discount shops, giving local operators steady pedestrian traffic. The creation of the Castle Hill Avenue Business Improvement District in 2012 formalized support for merchants along that spine, encouraging coordinated marketing, maintenance, and streetscape improvements that indirectly benefit Unionport to the north. 

Large-format retail is anchored nearby by the Shops at Bruckner Commons, a significantly expanded and renovated shopping center that physically separates Castle Hill from neighboring Soundview. This complex draws regional shoppers to national chain stores, increasing visibility and traffic flows through the broader trade area, including Unionport. On the eastern edge of the neighborhood, adjacent to Westchester Creek, land use shifts away from residential and retail into storage, warehousing, and municipal functions, reflecting a light-industrial and logistics role tied to waterfront adjacency. Transit access is a key commercial asset: the IRT Pelham Line’s Castle Hill Avenue station on the 6 and 6 trains, together with multiple Bronx bus routes such as the Bx4, Bx5, Bx22, Bx36, Bx39, Q44 SBS, and BxM8 express service, link workers and customers to local businesses, schools, and shopping centers including Bay Plaza. The Bruckner Expressway (I-278) runs through the area, bringing regional vehicular access but also historically bisecting land and influencing development patterns. Over time, infill projects and multi-zoned buildings with ground-floor retail have appeared as part of the response to the citywide housing crisis, adding new storefront opportunities at the base of residential structures. Combined with ongoing NYCHA-related renovations and mixed-income programming, these dynamics position Unionport and the surrounding Castle Hill area as a stable, service-oriented neighborhood market with embedded light-industrial and public-sector uses along its waterfront and arterial roads.
