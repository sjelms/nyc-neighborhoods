## Norwood

Norwood, also known as Bainbridge, is a residential neighborhood in the northwest Bronx, New York City, U.S. It is bound by Van Cortlandt Park and Woodlawn Cemetery to the north, the Bronx River to the east, and Mosholu Parkway to the southwest. The area is dominated topographically by what was once Valentine's Hill, the highest point being near the intersection of 210th Street and Bainbridge Avenue, where Gun Hill Road intersects, and around the Montefiore Medical Center, the largest landowner and employer of the neighborhood. Norwood's main commercial arteries are Gun Hill Road, Jerome Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Bainbridge Avenue.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Norwood, also known as Bainbridge, is a dense northwest Bronx neighborhood with its commercial activity concentrated along Gun Hill Road, Jerome Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Bainbridge Avenue, and anchored institutionally by Montefiore Medical Center, the area’s largest landowner and employer.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Former infrastructure such as the Williamsbridge Reservoir has been repurposed into Williamsbridge Oval park and community space, and historic structures like the Valentine–Varian House and the Keeper's House support cultural and civic uses amid a heavily built-out urban fabric.


- **THE MARKET:** With a 2010 population of about 40,500 on roughly half a square mile, high population density, modest median incomes, and heavy rent burden, Norwood supports value-oriented retail such as discount stores and neighborhood services, while healthcare, public institutions, and multifamily buildings dominate land use.

### Around the Block

Norwood is a compact, intensely built neighborhood in the northwest Bronx where institutional and neighborhood-serving commercial uses define the streetscape. Montefiore Medical Center stands out as the largest landowner and employer, anchoring a broad ecosystem of healthcare-related services and support businesses. The area’s main commercial arteries—Gun Hill Road, Jerome Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Bainbridge Avenue—carry most of the local retail, with storefronts and small businesses clustered especially around Bainbridge Avenue and East 204th Street. Historically, this commercial strip hosted Irish restaurants, groceries, and pubs and earned the moniker “Bainbridge” and “Little Belfast,” reflecting a once-prominent Irish population whose cultural and political life centered in local bars and social venues. Over time, economic shifts and demographic changes led to the closure of most Irish establishments, replaced in part by discount-oriented formats such as “99 Cent” stores, signaling a lower-income, value-focused retail environment.

Adaptive reuse and civic investment are visible in several key sites. The Williamsbridge Oval, originally an active reservoir for the North Bronx water supply network through the early 20th century, has been converted into a substantial public park with sports fields and recreational amenities that draw regular neighborhood traffic and activity. The former Keeper’s House at the reservoir, now restored and repurposed as a community space by the Mosholu Preservation Corporation, also serves as the headquarters of the Norwood News, adding a local media and nonprofit presence to the mix of uses. Historic assets such as the Valentine–Varian House, now housing the Museum of Bronx History, and significant religious and educational institutions like St. Brendan’s Church and School and the Shrine Church of St. Ann further diversify daytime population and foot traffic. High residential density and relatively low median incomes support a broad base of small-scale service providers, bodegas, and local retailers along the main corridors, while the area’s transportation network connects residents, workers, and visitors efficiently to the broader city and regional labor markets.

Transit access bolsters Norwood’s commercial viability and institutional role. The neighborhood is served by multiple subway stations on the D and 4 lines, with Norwood–205th Street and Mosholu Parkway providing direct access to key Manhattan and Brooklyn destinations. The Williams Bridge station on Metro-North’s Harlem Line, located on the eastern border, links the area directly to Grand Central and Westchester County, supporting commuting patterns for both residents and employees of major institutions. A dense grid of bus routes, including the Bx10, Bx16, Bx28, Bx34, Bx38, and Bx41, connects Norwood to Riverdale, Co-op City, Eastchester, and major Bronx retail centers like Bay Plaza, enhancing catchment for local businesses. Bee-Line routes BL4 and BL20 extend that reach into Yonkers, Cross County Shopping Center, and White Plains, giving Norwood a functional connection to suburban employment and shopping corridors. Combined with high local population density and significant healthcare infrastructure, this transit matrix makes Norwood a strongly transit-oriented neighborhood whose commercial corridors and community institutions draw from a wide area.
