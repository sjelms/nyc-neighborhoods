### Around the Block

Port Morris sits in the southwest corner of the Bronx as a classic New York industrial waterfront neighborhood in transition. For much of its history, it functioned as an industrial and manufacturing district, supported by deep-water port access on the East River and freight rail links such as the Port Morris Branch and the nearby Oak Point Yard. The area was dominated by 19th‑century factory and warehouse buildings convenient to the railroad yards, with notable businesses including the R. Hoe Co., Cutler & Hammer Tool Works, and the Estey Piano Company Factory, reflecting its legacy as a major piano manufacturing hub. Infrastructure such as the Hell Gate generating plant and the Bronx Grit Chamber, tied into the city’s wastewater system, further embedded Port Morris in the city’s heavy-utility and infrastructure network. The neighborhood’s commercial footprint suffered during the wave of arson in the 1970s, which damaged many residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, but late in the century industry began to return and long-vacant structures were rehabilitated.

Beginning in the late 1990s, city rezonings fundamentally reshaped the local commercial and development landscape. Creation and later expansion of the Port Morris Special Mixed-Use District, together with the Special Harlem River Waterfront District, opened large swaths of formerly industrial land to higher-density mixed-use and residential projects, especially along Bruckner Boulevard and the Harlem River. The eastern half of Port Morris remains primarily light industrial, warehousing, and distribution, under the Port Morris Industrial Business Zone, preserving space for logistics and production. At the same time, historic manufacturing buildings are being converted into lofts, offices, studios, and entertainment uses, such as the Clock Tower with its ground-floor restaurant and Union Crossing at 825 East 141st Street with offices, retail, and studios. Film and television production gained a foothold with Silvercup North’s 115,000‑square‑foot facility, while the Alexander Avenue–Bruckner Boulevard node has emerged as the main commercial corridor, now supporting a growing roster of restaurants and services. Large-scale riverfront projects like Bankside, along with The Arches and multiple mid- and high-rise developments on Third Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, are adding substantial mixed-use density and creating a new customer base for local retail. Concurrently, waterfront and greenway initiatives such as the Randall’s Island Connector, the South Bronx Greenway, and the planned Bronx Harlem River Greenway are improving access and public realm, enhancing the setting for future commercial and mixed-use investment tied to both local residents and regional visitors.
