Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are East 167th Street to the north, the Bronx River and the Bruckner Expressway to east, East 149th Street to the south, and Saint Anns Avenue to the west.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Longwood is a dense, mixed-use South Bronx neighborhood organized around Southern Boulevard, a primary commercial thoroughfare with a Business Improvement District supporting local retail and services.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** After decades of disinvestment and arson-related abandonment, sustained public and private reinvestment since the late 1980s has produced substantial new commercial space alongside modern residential construction and renovated pre-war structures.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated along Southern Boulevard and other main corridors, with small and mid-size businesses, a two-level 40,000-square-foot mall at Hunts Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, and ongoing infill development on formerly vacant lots.

### Around the Block

Longwood’s commercial spine is Southern Boulevard, a long-standing mixed-use corridor that now operates with the formal support of the Southern Boulevard Business Improvement District, established in 2008. This BID sits at a strategic point between the closest Pelham Line (6 and <6>) and White Plains Road Line (2 and 5) subway stations, giving ground-floor retailers and service providers strong transit exposure. Along Southern Boulevard and other primary avenues, the streetscape is lined with supermarkets, pharmacies, barbershops, salons, fast-food outlets, bodegas, and discount-oriented shops, creating a continuous, neighborhood-serving retail environment. These uses cater overwhelmingly to local demand, but they also benefit from through-traffic generated by nearby transit hubs and the Bruckner Expressway to the east. The presence of NYCHA developments and large pre-war apartment buildings provides a stable customer base for daily-needs retail and personal services.

The Crossings, a two-level 40,000-square-foot mall at Hunts Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, represents a more concentrated commercial node within the neighborhood fabric. Although an originally planned residential component was ultimately dropped, the finished project still created modern, multi-tenant retail space at a key intersection that connects Longwood to Hunts Point and to regional auto traffic via Bruckner Boulevard. This larger-format center complements the fine-grained storefronts on Southern Boulevard and nearby streets. Decades of public investment since the mid-1980s—over $550 million in subsidized housing and business expansion across the broader South Bronx—have supported the reopening and growth of small and large businesses, as well as institutional anchors like the South Bronx headquarters of the Police Athletic League and a relocated 41st Precinct facility on Longwood Avenue. Today, the neighborhood’s commercial sector operates amid a landscape of modern apartment buildings, rehabilitated pre-war stock, and semi-detached row houses in the Longwood Historic District, with transit-rich access that continues to underpin local commerce and service activity.
