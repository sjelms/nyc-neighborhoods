### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A compact Bronx neighborhood organized around East Tremont Avenue as its primary commercial thoroughfare, with some local institutional uses such as schools, a library branch, and a USPS station supporting neighborhood-serving retail and services.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Historic industrial and transportation roots, including former mills and carpet manufactories along the Bronx River and early railroad connectivity, echo in today’s bus depot and transit infrastructure, providing a legacy of logistics-oriented activity despite the area’s predominantly residential building stock.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is neighborhood-scaled, with bodegas far outnumbering supermarkets, scattered street-level retail along key avenues, and public/institutional sites like the West Farms Bus Depot and NYCHA towers anchoring demand; overall income levels are low and poverty and rent burden rates are high, which shapes price sensitivity and limits discretionary retail spend.

### Around the Block

West Farms occupies a compact footprint in the central Bronx, bounded by Bronx Park, the Bronx River, the Cross Bronx Expressway, and Southern Boulevard. Within this small area, East Tremont Avenue functions as the main commercial spine, carrying bus routes, local traffic, and neighborhood-serving retail. The land use pattern is dominated by five- and six-story tenement buildings and multi-unit structures, some of which incorporate ground-floor storefronts, along with vacant lots and new subsidized townhouses and apartment buildings. Public and institutional anchors—such as multiple public schools, the West Farms branch of the New York Public Library, and the local USPS West Farms Station—generate steady daytime foot traffic that benefits small-scale retailers and service providers.

Transit and transportation infrastructure are central to the neighborhood’s commercial dynamics. The West Farms Bus Depot, opened in 2003 on East 177th Street at the former Coliseum Depot site, is a major operational facility for MTA Regional Bus Operations and a significant local employer presence. Numerous bus routes converge in or pass through West Farms, including the Bx9, Bx19, Bx21, Bx36, Bx40, Bx42, the BxM10 express service, and the Q44 SBS, creating strong bus connectivity within the Bronx and to Manhattan and Queens. Two subway stations—East 180th Street and West Farms Square–East Tremont Avenue, both served by the 2 and 5 trains—provide rapid transit access, supporting worker commutes and customer access alike. Historically, the neighborhood sat at the head of navigable waters on the Bronx River, once hosting mills, carpet manufactories, and sloop traffic that tied West Farms to broader regional trade. While that industrial waterfront has largely given way to dense urban fabric and public housing, the legacy of manufacturing and rail-linked commerce remains visible in the area’s infrastructure and its role as a transit and bus operations hub.
