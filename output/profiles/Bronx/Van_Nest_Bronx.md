## Van Nest

Van Nest is a working-class neighborhood geographically located in the East Bronx section of the Bronx, New York City. Going clockwise, its boundaries are Bronxdale Avenue to the northeast, the Amtrak tracks to the southeast, and Bronx Park to the west. Van Nest predated Morris Park by 20 years and is considered the older of the two communities. Morris Park Avenue and White Plains Road are the primary commercial thoroughfares through Van Nest.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Van Nest is a compact East Bronx neighborhood with primary commercial activity along Morris Park Avenue and White Plains Road, complemented by small-scale service and institutional uses such as the Con Edison Van Nest Service Center and FDNY Engine 90/Ladder 41.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its rail-linked history and the large Con Edison facility on the former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad yards give the area a distinctive utility and infrastructure presence, while the newly rezoned districts around future Metro-North access position it for transit-oriented development.


- **THE MARKET:** With a 2011 population estimate of 13,909 in 0.424 sq mi and a working-class profile, the area supports neighborhood retail along its main corridors, and 2024 rezonings around the Parkchester/Van Nest station area are intended to encourage new mixed-use construction.

### Around the Block

Van Nest is a small but commercially active section of the East Bronx, where traditional neighborhood retail and legacy infrastructure shape its business environment. The spine of commercial activity runs along Morris Park Avenue and White Plains Road, which function as the primary thoroughfares for local shopping, services, food establishments, and institutional uses. Long-standing businesses such as Conti's Pastry Shoppe on Morris Park Avenue illustrate the corridor’s role as a local destination and support a steady pedestrian presence. Additional neighborhood-serving uses include the Parkway Station post office on White Plains Road and the Pelham Parkway–Van Nest branch of the New York Public Library on Barnes Avenue, which draw regular foot traffic. These corridors are supplemented by social, religious, and civic institutions—multiple churches, the Morris Park Boxing Club, and community organizations—providing consistent evening and weekend activity that benefits nearby storefronts.

The industrial and infrastructure footprint is anchored by Con Edison’s Van Nest Service Center, which occupies the former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad maintenance shops north of the Amtrak Northeast Corridor line between Unionport Road and Bronxdale Avenue. This 940,000-square-foot complex signals a significant utility presence, with legacy rail infrastructure still framing the southeastern edge of the neighborhood. The Amtrak Northeast Corridor and the proposed Parkchester–Van Nest Metro-North station tie Van Nest directly into regional rail infrastructure, a factor that underpins recent rezonings around Parkchester/Van Nest and Morris Park stations under the Penn Station Access project. The city’s commitment of $500 million in infrastructure upgrades around these stations is intended to catalyze development, setting the stage for higher-intensity, transit-oriented projects and increased demand for ground-floor commercial space. Local bus routes and subway access via the 2 and 5 trains at Bronx Park East and East 180th Street further knit Van Nest into the Bronx’s employment and retail network, supporting both daily workers at major facilities and customers along the main commercial corridors.
