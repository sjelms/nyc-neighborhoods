## Mott Haven

Mott Haven is a primarily residential neighborhood in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of the Bronx . It is generally bounded by East 149th Street to the north, the Bruckner Expressway to the east and south, and the Harlem River to the west, although these boundaries are not precise. East 138th Street is the primary east–west thoroughfare through Mott Haven.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Mott Haven is a dense South Bronx neighborhood with a mix of tenement-style multifamily buildings, large NYCHA public housing complexes, and historic brownstone districts, with East 138th Street as its primary commercial thoroughfare.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Historic districts such as the Mott Haven, Mott Haven East, and Bertine Block areas provide architecturally significant 19th‑century rowhouses and civic buildings that contrast with later high-rise public housing and industrial remnants like the former iron works site.


- **THE MARKET:** The area has seen recent redevelopment and early-stage gentrification pressures, including new luxury and affordable multifamily projects, a planned Hampton Inn, and branding efforts like the proposed Piano District, while overall remaining low-income and heavily renter-occupied.

### Around the Block

Mott Haven sits in the southwestern Bronx, directly connected to Manhattan via multiple bridges and regional truck and commuter corridors, which help support its commercial and institutional activity. East 138th Street is the main east–west spine through the neighborhood and functions as a key local retail and service corridor. Historically developed around Jordan Lawrence Mott’s iron works in the mid-19th century, the area still carries traces of its industrial past near the Harlem River and the approaches to the Third Avenue Bridge. Over time, that manufacturing base was joined and then overshadowed by high-density residential development, but commercial storefronts and neighborhood-serving businesses remain integrated into the ground floors of tenements and larger housing complexes. The presence of a high concentration of NYCHA developments brings substantial, stable foot traffic to local retailers and services. Civic and institutional anchors such as the Mott Haven branch of the New York Public Library and multiple churches, including St. Ann’s Episcopal Church and Saint Jerome’s, contribute both employment and steady neighborhood visitation.

Land use in Mott Haven is dominated by multifamily buildings—tenement-style walkups, large tower-in-the-park NYCHA complexes, and newer mid-rise residential buildings—interspersed with legacy industrial structures and community facilities. Three historic districts—Mott Haven, Mott Haven East, and the Bertine Block—contain architecturally distinctive brownstone rows that offer opportunities for adaptive reuse into office, community, or boutique commercial space where permitted. Contemporary development activity along the East 138th Street corridor includes projects such as The Joinery, a luxury mid‑rise condominium, and the Borinquen Court and Tres Puentes affordable housing complexes, indicating investor interest in both market‑rate and subsidized multifamily. Planned projects like two new affordable rental buildings and a Hampton Inn reflect expectations of growing demand from visitors and workers tied to nearby institutional hubs and highway access. The area’s role within the broader “South Bronx” branding narrative is evident in attempts to reposition parts of the waterfront as the Piano District, even if such branding has not fully taken hold. Throughout, the neighborhood’s extensive transit access—subways, buses, and regional bridges—supports a commuter and customer base that is critical for ground-floor retail and service-oriented businesses.
