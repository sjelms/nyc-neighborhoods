### Around the Block

Hunts Point’s commercial identity is defined by scale and logistics. The neighborhood sits on a peninsula at the confluence of the Bronx River and the East River, and its land area is overwhelmingly industrial. The Hunts Point Food Distribution Center alone covers 329 acres and incorporates major facilities for produce, meat, and seafood. The New York City Terminal Market moves roughly 2.7 billion pounds of produce annually through four massive warehouse buildings, each one‑third of a mile long, while the Hunts Point Cooperative Market offers 700,000 square feet of refrigerated space across six buildings. The New Fulton Fish Market complex adds another 450,000 square feet of temperature‑controlled distribution space, tying Hunts Point directly into regional food supply chains serving the broader New York metropolitan area and beyond. Over 800 industrial businesses employing more than 25,000 workers are based on the peninsula, with many concentrated in the officially zoned industrial business park. This concentration of wholesale, food processing, and distribution operations has helped solidify Hunts Point’s reputation as a premier logistics and industrial hub for the Tri‑State region.

Infrastructure and policy have been shaped around supporting this commercial ecosystem. Early in the 20th century, existing rail lines and abundant land attracted industry, and over time the area was formalized as an In‑Place‑Industrial Park. In 2004, the New York City Department of City Planning created the Special Hunts Point District to encourage continued growth of the food distribution center while cushioning a small, dense residential pocket along Hunts Point Avenue. Regional connectivity is reinforced through the Bruckner Expressway, nearby rail corridors, and multiple bus lines that directly serve the Hunts Point Cooperative Market and surrounding industrial blocks. Nonprofit economic development organizations such as the Hunts Point Economic Development Corporation and SoBRO have focused on securing incentives, infrastructure upgrades, and workforce training aligned with local business needs. At the same time, cultural institutions like THE POINT Community Development Corporation and the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, often housed in repurposed industrial spaces such as a former bagel factory or the American Bank Note Building, reflect a growing creative and community‑oriented layer on top of the area’s industrial base. Waterfront parks, including Hunts Point Riverside Park and Barretto Point Park, add recreational and environmental assets adjacent to working waterfront and industrial facilities, illustrating an ongoing mix of heavy commerce, civic investment, and adaptive reuse across the neighborhood.
