### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Morris Heights is a compact West Bronx neighborhood organized around University Avenue as its primary thoroughfare, with a street grid shaped by steep hills and step streets.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood’s Harlem River waterfront once supported a major shipbuilding firm, indicating an industrial legacy that contrasts with today’s predominantly residential and institutional landscape.


- **THE MARKET:** Land use is dominated by mid-rise tenement buildings, rehabilitated NYCHA developments, and newly constructed subsidized attached multi-unit townhouses and apartment buildings on formerly vacant lots, reflecting ongoing public-sector reinvestment and largely renter-occupied housing stock.

### Around the Block

Morris Heights occupies a small but densely built section of the West Bronx, with a total land area of less than half a square mile and a population approaching 37,000 residents. The neighborhood’s commercial and institutional activity is organized primarily along University Avenue, which functions as the main artery for local traffic, bus service, and neighborhood-serving retail. The terrain is notably elevated, with many hills and a network of step streets that connect different elevations, shaping how people and goods move through the area and influencing where ground-floor retail and services can most effectively cluster. While today it reads largely as a residential district with many mid-rise buildings, the presence of the Harlem River at the western edge and the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the south places Morris Heights adjacent to important regional transportation and freight corridors.

Historically, Morris Heights had a more explicitly industrial profile along its waterfront, where the Gas Engine & Power Company & Charles L. Seabury Company operated a shipbuilding firm on Mathewson Road near what is now Roberto Clemente State Park. That operation, active from the late 19th century until after World War II, tied the neighborhood to regional maritime and manufacturing activity before the company relocated to City Island. In the decades that followed, especially after the arson-driven disinvestment of the 1970s, much of the building stock was damaged or lost, prompting extensive public-sector rehabilitation and redevelopment. Today, land use is dominated by five- and six-story tenement buildings, older multi-unit homes, and a large portfolio of NYCHA developments that have been rehabilitated, alongside newly constructed subsidized townhouses and apartment buildings on vacant lots. This pattern of public and subsidized housing creates a stable resident base that supports local retail and services, including health facilities such as the Morris Heights Health Center. High bus and subway accessibility, combined with Metro-North service at Morris Heights station, link this neighborhood to broader employment centers, enabling worker flows and customer access for small businesses as reinvestment continues.
