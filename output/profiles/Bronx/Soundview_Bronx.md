### Key Details

### Around the Block

Soundview occupies the Clason Point peninsula in the southern Bronx and is organized around several strong transportation spines, including the Bruckner Expressway, Bronx River Parkway, and Soundview Avenue. Westchester Avenue carries the IRT Pelham Line and a heavy flow of riders to multiple subway stops, giving storefronts there steady, transit-driven foot traffic. The neighborhood’s primary commercial corridors—White Plains Road, Soundview Avenue, and Westchester Avenue—host supermarkets, pharmacies, bodegas, barbershops, salons, fast food, and discount shops, creating an everyday retail ecosystem for local residents. Bruckner Commons, a major shopping center that was greatly expanded in the 1990s and renovated in 2018, anchors the eastern edge of Soundview and separates it from Castle Hill while drawing in regional shoppers to national chains like The Gap and Old Navy. This concentration of retail, supported by dense housing, underpins strong local demand for small-format commercial spaces and service businesses.

The western edge of Soundview along the Bronx River is primarily used for storage, warehousing, and automotive repair and modification, giving the neighborhood a meaningful industrial and back-of-house logistics component. This industrial band benefits from the adjacency to major roadways like the Cross Bronx Expressway, the Bruckner Expressway, and the Bronx River Parkway, which facilitate trucking and regional access. Within the interior blocks there is a heavy presence of large-scale residential complexes and one of the highest concentrations of NYCHA developments in New York City, providing a stable, though largely low-income, customer base and workforce. Recent years have seen the construction of modern multi-unit row houses and apartment buildings, many with multi-zoned ground floors for retail uses and mixed-income qualifications, signaling gradual infill and some upgrading of the built environment. Creative industries have gained a foothold as well: York Studios’ Michelangelo Campus motion picture and television production facility on Story Avenue and the News 12 The Bronx studios on Soundview Avenue highlight the area’s evolving media and production profile. Soundview Park, a 205-acre waterfront park built on former landfill, has been reimagined with greenways, trails, and recreation amenities, improving quality of life and positioning the waterfront as an environmental and recreational asset that can support complementary commercial uses nearby. Ferry service from the Soundview route, multiple bus lines, and several Pelham Line subway stations together enhance overall accessibility, making the neighborhood a practical base for both neighborhood-serving retail and light industrial or production-focused enterprises.
