### Around the Block

Eastchester in the northeast Bronx presents a compact but varied commercial and land-use profile. The neighborhood’s core corridors, Boston Road and East 233rd Street, function as its principal thoroughfares, carrying both local and through traffic and anchoring an array of neighborhood-serving businesses. Dyre Avenue, which intersects both of these routes, is explicitly described as the main commercial strip, concentrating day-to-day retail and service activity. This alignment of streets creates a commercial framework that supports nearby housing, including both smaller homes and large multifamily developments, and ties the neighborhood into the broader Bronx and southern Westchester trade area.

Retail and services are reinforced by purpose-built centers like Shopwell Plaza on Boston Road, adjacent to the Boston-Secor housing project, which provide a focal point for shopping and daily needs. In the far northeastern section, near the Hutchinson River, Eastchester edges into a cross-border consumer catchment, with a nearby shopping center in Pelham Manor shaping perceptions of that area. The neighborhood also includes a defined industrial district, adding a production and logistics component to the local economy and taking advantage of flat, low-lying terrain and proximity to major roads like the New England Thruway. Large-scale NYCHA developments such as Edenwald Houses, the largest NYCHA complex in the Bronx, and Boston Secor Houses add substantial residential density, creating steady demand for retail, schools, community services and transit. Together, these elements make Eastchester a small but active node of commercial, institutional, and light industrial uses within Community District 12, with economic linkages extending to Mount Vernon, Co-op City, Morris Park’s major medical institutions, and shopping destinations across the Bronx–Westchester line.
