### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Concourse Village, as part of the larger Concourse area, centers on the Grand Concourse and 161st Street, combining civic institutions such as the Bronx County Courthouse and Bronx Hall of Justice with major sports, cultural, and retail destinations including Yankee Stadium, Bronx Museum of the Arts, and Concourse Plaza.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its dense South Bronx setting, the neighborhood offers multiple parks, a growing waterfront promenade along the Harlem River, and cultural anchors like the future Universal Hip Hop Museum and expanded Bronx Museum of the Arts alongside active retail corridors.


- **THE MARKET:** The market features established and newer retail nodes around 161st, 165th, and 167th Streets, large-format retail at Bronx Terminal Market, and ongoing public and private investment including a $300 million mixed-use redevelopment along the Harlem River, indicating continued interest in commercial and institutional uses.

### Around the Block

Concourse Village sits within the broader Concourse area at the core of a dense civic and commercial hub in the South Bronx. The intersection of Grand Concourse and 161st Street anchors a cluster of public institutions such as the Bronx County Courthouse, Bronx Hall of Justice, and multiple New York Public Library branches, generating consistent daytime traffic. Yankee Stadium and the surrounding Macombs Dam Park and Mill Pond Park bring stadium-scale visitation, supporting food, beverage, and entertainment uses while tying directly into Metro-North’s Yankees–East 153rd Street station. Nearby, Bronx Terminal Market functions as a major retail complex along the Harlem River, contributing to the area’s more industrialized riverfront character and drawing regional shoppers. This mix of government, cultural, and sports-related activity underpins a steady flow of workers, visitors, and residents that supports a wide range of neighborhood-serving retail.

Along the Grand Concourse, the IND Concourse Line (B and D trains) runs beneath a historic boulevard that has seen significant capital, aesthetic, and safety improvements by the city, enhancing its role as the primary commercial spine. Retail is generally concentrated on the cross streets, with major nodes at 161st Street and adjacent blocks at Concourse Plaza, and additional smaller clusters on 165th and 167th Streets. The avenues above 153rd Street are described as largely residential with the exception of Morris Avenue, which still provides some mixed-use activity, while the riverfront remains more industrial in character outside of parkland and the Bronx Terminal Market. Transit connectivity is robust: in addition to the B, D, and 4 subway lines, the area is served by several key Bronx bus routes, the Macombs Dam Bridge into Manhattan, and nearby Metro-North service, supporting both local commerce and regional access. Recent and planned projects, including the new Yankee Stadium, the expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, and a large Harlem River redevelopment with a waterfront promenade and Universal Hip Hop Museum, signal ongoing reinvestment and potential for further commercial and cultural growth.
