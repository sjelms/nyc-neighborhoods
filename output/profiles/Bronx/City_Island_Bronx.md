### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A compact, low-scale commercial strip centered on City Island Avenue, dominated by seafood restaurants, marinas, yacht clubs, and boating-related services with limited general retail.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The island’s strong nautical identity, historic shipbuilding legacy, and concentration of marinas and yacht clubs create a specialized waterfront economy that also attracts tourism and film production.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is largely small-business driven, with restaurants, antique shops, and marine services supplemented by a small supermarket, gas station, bank, and hardware store; some former boatyards have been converted into condominiums, indicating pressure on industrial and marine-support uses.

### Around the Block

City Island presents a distinctive commercial environment built around its maritime setting at the western end of Long Island Sound. The main business corridor, City Island Avenue, carries almost all neighborhood-facing and visitor-facing commercial activity, from a small supermarket and gas station to a bank, hardware store, and a range of small shops. The dominant sector is food and beverage, especially seafood; the island is famous for its numerous seafood restaurants and lobster-focused menus, many of which line both sides of City Island Avenue and cluster at Belden Point on the southern tip. This hospitality concentration gives the area a strong daytripper and destination-restaurant profile, with Belden Point historically operating as an amusement and resort area and now functioning as a popular waterfront dining node. Antique stores along the avenue complement the restaurant trade and help position the corridor as a niche retail and leisure destination rather than a conventional neighborhood shopping street.

Water-dependent and marine-support uses remain central to the local economy. The island hosts three yacht clubs on the Eastchester Bay side—the Harlem Yacht Club, City Island Yacht Club, and Morris Yacht and Beach Club—along with the Touring Kayak Club on the west side. Additional boatyards and marinas, including Barron’s Boatyard, North Minneford Yacht Club, South Minneford Yacht Club, and several commercial marinas, provide berthing, services, and race organization through the Eastchester Bay Yacht Racing Association. City Island also offers special anchorages, numerous docks, and large piers capable of receiving sizable vessels, supporting both recreational boating and charter fishing operations. A small fleet of head boats takes paying passengers on fishing trips into Long Island Sound, and smaller craft are available for daily rental, reinforcing a visitor-oriented waterfront economy. At the same time, the text notes that the sail and power boating industry has been declining as boatyards are sold and converted to condominiums, signaling a gradual shift in land use away from working waterfront toward residential development. Cultural and media uses, including a local nautical museum in a historic school building, an active community theater group, and a film production studio, add creative and heritage-based layers to this commercially focused, maritime neighborhood.
