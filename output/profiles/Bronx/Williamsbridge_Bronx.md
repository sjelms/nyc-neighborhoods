### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Williamsbridge is a low-rise, lower-density Bronx neighborhood organized around White Plains Road as its primary commercial thoroughfare, with most land use dominated by small-scale residential buildings rather than large commercial or industrial facilities.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its modest scale, Williamsbridge supports essential neighborhood retail and services along its main corridors and benefits from proximity to major medical institutions such as Montefiore Medical Center’s Wakefield Campus and other large hospitals in nearby Morris Park.


- **THE MARKET:** The area is primarily zoned and planned for low-density residential use, with proposed rezonings focused on preserving detached and small multi-unit housing stock, limiting opportunities for large-scale commercial, mixed-use, or industrial development along its corridors.

### Around the Block

Williamsbridge occupies a north-central position in the Bronx, with its footprint defined by East 222nd Street, Boston Road, Adee Avenue, and the Bronx River. Within these boundaries, land use is dominated by multi-family homes and moderate-size multi-unit buildings, with the majority of structures being private, owner-occupied two- and three-story houses. This built form results in a distinctly low-rise skyline where few buildings exceed 70 feet, even in the more densely developed pockets of the neighborhood. White Plains Road serves as the primary thoroughfare, functioning as the main spine for local commerce, services, and transit, and tying together the residential side streets into a coherent urban fabric.

From a planning and investment perspective, Williamsbridge is shaped heavily by city policy aimed at reinforcing its low-density profile. The New York City Department of City Planning has proposed zoning map changes for 36 blocks in the Williamsbridge/Olinville area specifically to preserve its lower density character. A related zoning text amendment would establish a new R5A district, tailored to the neighborhood’s existing pattern of detached and semi-detached homes and preventing out-of-scale infill. While this reduces the potential for high-intensity commercial or industrial redevelopment, it also provides stability for small-scale property owners and neighborhood retail along corridors such as White Plains Road, Boston Road, Gun Hill Road, and Webster Avenue. Transit access is robust for a low-rise district: two subway stations on the 2 and 5 lines at Gun Hill Road and 219th Street, multiple Bronx bus routes, and the nearby Williams Bridge station on the Metro-North Harlem Line all support worker and customer access to local businesses. Proximity to major medical campuses in Williamsbridge and nearby Morris Park further reinforces steady daytime population and institutional employment, even as the core of the neighborhood remains primarily residential in use.
