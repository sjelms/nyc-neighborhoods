## Pelham Bay

Pelham Bay is a middle class residential neighborhood in the borough of the Bronx, in New York City. It is named for Pelham Bay Park, New York City's largest park, which lies on the neighborhood's northeastern border; and for Pelham Bay, a body of water in that park. The neighborhood is bounded roughly by Pelham Parkway on the north, the New England Thruway ( I-95 ) on the east, the Bruckner Expressway (I-95) on the south, and the Hutchinson River Parkway on the west.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Pelham Bay is a low- to mid-rise, predominantly single- and two-family housing area with a stable, middle-income consumer base and neighborhood-serving retail concentrated along Westchester Avenue, Buhre Avenue, Middletown Road, and Crosby Avenue.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood combines close access to Pelham Bay Park and major highways with relatively low crime, active civic associations, and local zoning that has historically limited large multifamily and subsidized housing, supporting a consistent retail and service environment.


- **THE MARKET:** Real estate values in Pelham Bay have grown faster than other Bronx residential areas, with zoning laws helping maintain a single- to two-family character and generating resistance to proposed low-income multifamily construction adjacent to existing homes.

### Around the Block

Pelham Bay presents itself as a stable, middle-class Bronx neighborhood whose commercial character is closely tied to its residential base and transportation network. Retail and service businesses line several local corridors, most notably Westchester Avenue, Buhre Avenue, Middletown Road, and Crosby Avenue, where the latter two meet to form one of the neighborhood’s primary intersections. These streets host a variety of stores and eateries, supporting day-to-day needs of local households and creating consistent foot traffic for neighborhood merchants. The presence of an active civic culture, including organizations like the Pelham Bay Little League, reinforces a community-oriented environment that neighborhood businesses can tap into through sponsorships and local engagement. Proximity to Pelham Bay Park on the northeastern edge adds recreational draw, which can modestly benefit food, beverage, and convenience operators, especially near transit nodes.

From an access and logistics standpoint, Pelham Bay is particularly well positioned. It is framed by major vehicular arteries: Pelham Parkway to the north, the New England Thruway (I-95) to the east, the Bruckner Expressway (I-95) to the south, and the Hutchinson River Parkway to the west. This highway ring makes the neighborhood easily reachable by car and enhances its appeal for auto-oriented retail and service uses. Internally, the core of Pelham Bay sits west of I-95 and north of Middletown Road, with the Country Club enclave occupying the portion east of I-95. Public transportation is robust, with three subway stations on the 6 and 6 lines—Middletown Road, Buhre Avenue, and Pelham Bay Park—providing direct access to Manhattan and other Bronx submarkets, and generating strong transit-adjacent retail opportunities. Multiple local and express bus routes, including Bx5, Bx8, Bx12 and Bx12 SBS, Bx23, Bx24, Bx29, Q50, BxM8, and Bee-Line BL45, further connect Pelham Bay to Co-op City, City Island, Westchester County, and key shopping and employment centers like Bay Plaza. Together, these transportation assets and the area’s relatively low crime rates underpin a stable environment for neighborhood-serving commercial and professional uses rather than heavy industrial or warehouse operations.
