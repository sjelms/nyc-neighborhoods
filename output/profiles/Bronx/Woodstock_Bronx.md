## Woodstock

Longwood is a mixed-use neighborhood in the southeast Bronx in New York City. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are East 167th Street to the north, the Bronx River and the Bruckner Expressway to east, East 149th Street to the south, and Saint Anns Avenue to the west. Southern Boulevard is the primary thoroughfare through Longwood.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Longwood is a dense, mixed-use South Bronx neighborhood organized around Southern Boulevard, with commercial corridors emerging near subway stations and primary thoroughfares.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** A long-standing business improvement district on Southern Boulevard, the landmark Crossings mall at Hunts Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, and the protected Longwood Historic District add institutional support, retail concentration, and architectural character to an area once dominated by blight.


- **THE MARKET:** The commercial environment reflects ongoing reinvestment since the mid-1980s, with subsidized housing, new mixed-use buildings, small and large businesses, and limited basic retail amenities such as supermarkets, pharmacies, bodegas, and discount shops serving a largely low-income customer base.

### Around the Block

Longwood’s commercial spine is Southern Boulevard, a long-standing, mixed-use corridor that has been formalized by the Southern Boulevard Business Improvement District since 2008. This BID sits between two closely spaced rapid transit corridors, the IRT Pelham Line (6) and the White Plains Road Line (2, 5), which helps concentrate pedestrian traffic and supports neighborhood retail. Other main thoroughfares carry the everyday commercial program: supermarkets, pharmacies, barbershops, hair salons, fast food outlets, bodegas, and low-cost shops that provide core goods and services to a dense local population. The stock of pre-war 5- and 6‑story apartment buildings built to the sidewalk lines much of the area, with ground floors often positioned for small retail and service users near transit and key intersections.

Historic disinvestment and arson in the greater South Bronx left Longwood with large swaths of vacant land and a severe shortage of commercial amenities in the late 20th century. Beginning in the mid-1980s, federal, city, and NYCHA initiatives brought more than $550 million in reinvestment, focused on subsidized residential construction and expansion of businesses and commerce. This period also brought civic and institutional anchors, including the South Bronx headquarters of the Police Athletic League and the relocation of the 41st Precinct to Longwood Avenue, which increased daily foot traffic and public-sector employment. On formally vacant lots, new housing and mixed-use structures have multiplied, joining renovated pre-war buildings and attached row houses to create stronger retail adjacencies for small businesses.

Retail and community services are supported by several transit nodes that tie Longwood into the broader Bronx economy. Multiple subway stations on the 2, 5, and 6 lines—such as Simpson Street, Longwood Avenue, Hunts Point Avenue, and Prospect Avenue—provide direct access to major job centers and also act as magnets for ground-floor retail. The Crossings, a two-level, 40,000-square-foot mall at Hunts Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, is a key shopping destination, though an initially planned residential component was abandoned. Bus routes along Bruckner Boulevard, Westchester Avenue, Southern Boulevard, and cross streets connect residents and businesses to Co-op City, Bay Plaza Shopping Center, the New York Botanical Garden, and the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal. Although social and economic challenges persist, the layering of transit, BID activity, infill development, and neighborhood-scale retail has turned Longwood into a functioning commercial ecosystem that serves both local demand and workers moving through the South Bronx.
