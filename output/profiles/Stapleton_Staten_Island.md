### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Stapleton is an older Staten Island waterfront neighborhood with a legacy as a historic commercial center along Upper New York Bay, with activity focused on Bay Street, the waterfront piers, and the former Homeport site.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its underutilized waterfront and former military and industrial facilities have attracted redevelopment plans, including mixed-use projects, a promenade, a skatepark, and potential creative uses such as studios and courts alongside FDNY Marine operations and Fleet Week activities.


- **THE MARKET:** Recent and planned projects such as the Urby complex, additional mixed-use housing and commercial development at the former Stapleton Homeport, and the Stapleton Beacon initiative signal ongoing reinvestment and repositioning of waterfront land for residential, retail, and community-serving commercial uses.

### Around the Block

Stapleton occupies a strategic position on Staten Island’s northeastern waterfront, fronting Upper New York Bay and historically oriented around its piers, ferry service, and Bay Street corridor. Originally developed in the 1830s by William J. Staples and Minthorne Tompkins on Vanderbilt family land, it quickly became the commercial center of Southfield Township, supported by a ferry link to Manhattan and later the Staten Island Railway extension to St. George. The waterfront hosted multiple German-American breweries in the 19th century, demonstrating early industrial use of local springs, and later evolved into a complex maritime logistics zone. In the early 20th century, city-built piers formed the first Foreign Trade Zone in the United States, then transitioned during World War II into the Staten Island Terminal facility of the Army’s New York Port of Embarkation. For decades, the U.S. Coast Guard also operated a significant base there, underscoring the area’s longstanding role in harbor-related activity.

After wartime peak utilization, however, the waterfront suffered from declining industrial use, demolition of most piers by the 1970s, and the loss of direct ferry service. A controversial 1980s–1990s attempt to convert part of Stapleton’s shoreline into a naval homeport for the battleship USS Iowa was ultimately cancelled, leaving behind partially developed infrastructure and a large underutilized site. Subsequent proposals—from a race track to a bagel manufacturing facility and a movie studio—illustrate both demand and uncertainty about highest and best use of the waterfront land. Ultimately, the city approved a major redevelopment blueprint for the former Navy base, planning 350 housing units, restaurants, a recreation center, markets, and a mile-long esplanade, supported by new streets and utilities to unlock multiple residential and commercial pads. More recently, a 900-apartment Urby complex opened on the former Homeport site, and an additional mixed-use project with 500 apartments is planned nearby, alongside the Stapleton Beacon project and a new promenade under the North Shore Action Plan. These initiatives, combined with existing cultural and entertainment venues, a diverse restaurant mix, NYC Arts Cypher, and 5050 Skatepark on Front Street, are repositioning Stapleton’s waterfront from a declining industrial zone into a mixed commercial, residential, and recreational district while still hosting FDNY Marine Company 9 and serving as a key Fleet Week site.
