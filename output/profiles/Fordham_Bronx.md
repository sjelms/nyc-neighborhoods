### Around the Block

Fordham has evolved from a rural waystation into one of the Bronx’s key business and transportation hubs. The area around Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse, historically known as Old Fordham Village, remains the commercial heart of the neighborhood and is now home to the Fordham Road Business Improvement District, noted as the longest retail district in the Bronx. This corridor concentrates storefront retail and services while benefiting from heavy pedestrian and transit flows. The neighborhood’s commercial activity is further anchored by Fordham University’s Rose Hill campus and Monroe College, which bring a sizable student and staff population that supports food, retail, and service-oriented businesses in the surrounding streets. 

Institutional and cultural uses play an outsized role in Fordham’s economic profile. The New York Botanical Garden and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo occupy dozens of acres in Bronx Park within the neighborhood, drawing visitors from across the city and region. These attractions, combined with Fordham Plaza’s transit connections, help position Fordham as a gateway for tourism-related spending in the West Bronx. Built form is characterized by continuous 5- and 6-story buildings set flush to the sidewalk, especially along major corridors, creating an urban environment well suited to ground-floor commercial uses with residential or institutional space above. Taller structures on the Grand Concourse reinforce its role as a major north–south spine. The presence of Metro-North Railroad at Fordham Station, multiple subway lines, and extensive local and intercounty bus service makes the neighborhood a natural node for logistics-light uses, educational facilities, and high-foot-traffic retail. Combined, these elements make Fordham a dense, transit-served commercial district with strong institutional anchors and significant visitor draw from universities, cultural institutions, and regional attractions.
