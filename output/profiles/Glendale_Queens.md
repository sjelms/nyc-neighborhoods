Glendale is a neighborhood in the west-central portion of the New York City borough of Queens . It is bounded by Forest Hills to the east, Ridgewood to the west, Woodhaven to the south, and Middle Village to the north.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A long, narrow Queens neighborhood with a central commercial spine on Myrtle Avenue, smaller business strips on Cooper, Metropolitan, and Woodhaven Boulevards, and a mix of legacy industrial uses, rail yards, and mid- to small-scale retail serving a stable working- to middle-class customer base.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its manufacturing and freight-rail legacy, Glendale is buffered by cemeteries and Forest Park, which insulate the area from heavier through-traffic while still providing access to multiple bus routes and nearby LIRR and subway connections for workers and shoppers.


- **THE MARKET:** Former industrial facilities like Atlas Terminal have transitioned into open-air and big-box-oriented retail such as The Shops at Atlas Park, with national chains including Trader Joe’s, Staples, Michael’s, Chili’s, and Home Depot occupying repurposed or adjacent sites; industrial rail infrastructure remains active for freight and waste transfer, anchoring a logistics-oriented segment of the local CRE market.

### Around the Block

Glendale sits in west-central Queens as a long east–west corridor hemmed in by Forest Park and extensive cemeteries often called the Cemetery Belt. Historically a farming and then textile-and-brewery hub, the area evolved into a significant industrial district anchored by the Atlas Terminal, a 16-factory industrial park that employed a large skilled workforce and played a role in World War II production and the Manhattan Project’s supply chain. That industrial base was closely tied to rail: during the war much of the aircraft and military equipment made on Long Island was shipped by rail through Glendale. Even after passenger service declined and the local LIRR station closed in 1998, rail infrastructure remained a defining commercial asset. The neighborhood’s northern edge follows the Montauk Branch of the LIRR, while its borders are completed by the Bay Ridge Branch and Fresh Pond Road, and it is intersected by the Rockaway Beach Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad.

Today, Atlas Terminal’s demolition and replacement by The Shops at Atlas Park exemplify Glendale’s shift from heavy industry toward retail and service-oriented commerce. National retailers such as Trader Joe’s and Chili’s have taken over former industrial buildings, and big-box concepts like Staples, Michael’s, and Home Depot cluster along Woodhaven Boulevard and Cooper Avenue, drawing shoppers from surrounding Queens neighborhoods. Myrtle Avenue remains the primary business district, with a long tradition as the neighborhood’s commercial spine dating back to steam trolleys and family-run stores in the late 19th century. The area’s freight infrastructure still has regional economic importance: all goods shipped by rail to Long Island must move through the Fresh Pond/Fremont Yards in Glendale, which connect the Montauk Branch, Bay Ridge Branch, Bushwick Branch, and New York Connecting Railroad to national rail corridors. Today the largest outbound products are municipal waste and construction and demolition debris, making Glendale a critical logistics and transfer node. Bus routes linking to multiple subway lines and nearby LIRR stations in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens provide workforce access to these retail, logistics, and service jobs, even as Glendale itself maintains a relatively quiet, middle-class commercial character.
