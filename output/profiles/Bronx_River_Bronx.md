### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** The Bronx River corridor contains legacy industrial sites such as early water mills, including the preserved Lorillard Snuff Mill within the New York Botanical Garden, as well as hospital-related development where portions of the river were realigned to create buildable land.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Ongoing environmental rehabilitation and the development of the Bronx River Greenway, Concrete Plant Park, Starlight Park, and Shoelace Park have transformed sections of a once heavily polluted industrial waterway into accessible open space that supports recreational boating and waterfront activation.


- **THE MARKET:** Historic manufacturing along the river produced paper, pottery, flour, tapestries, and snuff, but with the decline of manufacturing the focus has shifted toward restoration, parkland, and greenway projects adjacent to the river, alongside institutional anchors such as Lawrence Hospital, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Bronx Zoo.

### Around the Block

The Bronx River is a 24‑mile waterway that has long structured commercial and industrial activity along its banks, from Westchester County into the Bronx. Historically, this corridor hosted roughly a dozen water mills by the early 18th century, producing paper, pottery, flour, tapestries, and snuff, indicating an early concentration of water‑powered manufacturing. One of the best-known remnants of this industrial era is the Lorillard Snuff Mill, which has been preserved within the grounds of the New York Botanical Garden, serving as a tangible link between contemporary cultural-institutional uses and the river’s manufacturing legacy. The river also played a role in institutional real estate development: in Bronxville, its course was straightened in 1948 to eliminate a curve and reclaim the old riverbed for an addition to Lawrence Hospital, showing how hydrologic engineering directly enabled expansion of healthcare facilities.

Over the 19th and 20th centuries, the river effectively functioned as a natural sewer, taking in industrial waste and later municipal pollution from communities along the corridor, which diminished its value as an amenity and constrained its commercial attractiveness. In recent decades, however, coordinated efforts led by groups such as the Bronx River Alliance and the Bronx River Watershed Coalition have focused on watershed management and water‑quality improvements, backed by significant federal funding and inter-municipal agreements to stop sewage discharges. These environmental improvements have supported a shift toward recreation and green infrastructure, anchored by the Bronx River Parkway and its parallel bicycle path, and by the Bronx River Greenway project, which seeks unified management of riverside green spaces in Westchester and the Bronx. New and improved parks, including Concrete Plant Park and Starlight Park, reuse former industrial landscapes to provide waterfront access and active open space. In the South Bronx, the river is now a destination for urban canoeing, and a small pier at 219th Street in Shoelace Park enables canoe and kayak access, adding a water‑recreation component that can complement nearby commercial and institutional uses. The river also bisects Bronx Park and runs through the Bronx Zoo, where a monorail carries visitors over the river, integrating the waterway into a major regional attraction and reinforcing the corridor’s role as a spine for civic, educational, and recreational investment rather than heavy industry.
