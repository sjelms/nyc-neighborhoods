### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** DUMBO is a compact, historic waterfront district characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, many of which have been adaptively reused for office, retail, cultural, and residential loft space.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood combines landmarked industrial architecture and Belgian block streets with a dense cluster of art galleries, cultural venues, and a nationally significant concentration of technology firms in the Brooklyn Tech Triangle.


- **THE MARKET:** Former factories and warehouses have been repositioned as high-end condos, mixed-use office and retail campuses, and tech-oriented workspaces, supporting some of the highest concentrations of tech and creative tenants in New York City at office rents historically below comparable Manhattan space.

### Around the Block

DUMBO’s contemporary commercial identity is rooted in its industrial past as a manufacturing district serving the Brooklyn waterfront. The area once housed factories and warehouses for machinery, paper boxes, spices, paint, coffee, sugar, and Brillo soap pads, with the waterfront served by the Jay Street Connecting Railroad, car float operations, and spurs running directly into industrial buildings. This concentration of legacy industrial architecture—among the earliest large-scale reinforced concrete factory buildings in America—underpins today’s adaptive reuse projects and historic district protections. Many of these structures, such as the former Brillo Manufacturing Co. building at 200 Water Street and the Civil War-era Empire Stores coffee warehouse, have transitioned into high-end condos, office space, and retail, demonstrating DUMBO’s shift from heavy manufacturing to creative and knowledge-based industries.

In recent decades, DUMBO has emerged as one of New York City’s premier arts and tech districts, with a dense cluster of for-profit galleries, nonprofit arts institutions, and performing arts venues driving visitor traffic and supporting ground-floor retail. Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Fulton Landing waterfront have attracted destination dining and experiential concepts, including notable restaurants, dessert and bakery operators, Bargemusic’s floating classical music venue, and the large outdoor climbing facility The Cliffs at DUMBO. Empire Stores now combines flagship retail for brands like West Elm and Shinola with offices and cultural anchors such as the Brooklyn Historical Society and the Time Out Market food hall. At the same time, DUMBO hosts the highest neighborhood-level concentration of tech firms in New York City, with roughly 500 tech and creative companies employing more than 10,000 people within a ten-block radius, plus NYU-supported incubator space. This ecosystem, supported by frequent ferry service, subway access, and pedestrian connections to the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, continues to position DUMBO as a key node for Brooklyn’s innovation economy, tourism, and high-end mixed-use development.
