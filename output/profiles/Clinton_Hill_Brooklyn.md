### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Clinton Hill is an affluent, north-central Brooklyn neighborhood with a core institutional presence from Pratt Institute and St. Joseph's College, anchored by DeKalb Avenue as its main thoroughfare and near the Brooklyn Navy Yard to the north.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** A large swath of the area is designated as the Clinton Hill and Clinton Hill South Historic Districts, with numerous individually landmarked church, institutional, and former estate buildings that have been adaptively reused, including a former chocolate factory converted to loft apartments.


- **THE MARKET:** The built environment is a mix of apartment houses, landmarked mansions along Clinton Avenue, and historic rowhouses, with some former industrial structures such as the 1890s Tootsie Roll factory at 275 Park Avenue converted to residential lofts, reflecting ongoing gentrification and upper-middle-class growth.

### Around the Block

Clinton Hill occupies a strategically located position in north-central Brooklyn, bordered by the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Flushing Avenue to the north and Atlantic Avenue to the south. This proximity to the Navy Yard links the neighborhood to one of Brooklyn’s longstanding industrial and maritime hubs, while Flushing and Atlantic Avenues function as important commercial and circulation corridors around its edges. The neighborhood’s main internal spine is DeKalb Avenue, which serves as a primary thoroughfare connecting local institutions, retail, and services. Historically, Clinton Hill’s appeal was tied to its elevation and its views down to the East River and Manhattan, drawing early affluent residents and commercial leaders who could conveniently reach the nearby Navy Yard and ferry links.

Over time, Clinton Hill developed a strong institutional and creative character, anchored by Pratt Institute, founded in 1887 as an engineering school to train immigrants in emerging technical fields. Pratt has since evolved into a major center for architecture, graphic design, interior design, and industrial design, attracting a significant community of artists, architects, photographers, and craftspeople to live and work in the area. St. Joseph’s College also maintains a Brooklyn campus in Clinton Hill and occupies several of the former Pratt family mansions, reinforcing the neighborhood’s educational and institutional footprint. The landmarked Clinton Hill Historic District and the later Clinton Hill South Historic District encompass many 19th-century mansions, villas, churches, and intact runs of rowhouses, which contribute to a high-value, historically distinctive building stock. Some older industrial properties have shifted to residential and mixed-use functions, most notably the brick building at 275 Park Avenue, originally a chocolate factory producing Tootsie Rolls for national distribution, which was converted into loft apartments in 2002.

Transit access is a key support for Clinton Hill’s commercial and institutional life. The neighborhood is served by the IND Fulton Street Line, with the A and C trains stopping at Clinton–Washington Avenues, and by the G train on the IND Crosstown Line at Classon Avenue and Clinton–Washington Avenues. Multiple local bus routes—B25, B26, B38, B45, B48, B52, B54, B57, B62, and B69—provide crosstown and inter-neighborhood connectivity that links Clinton Hill to adjacent districts and employment centers. In addition, NYC Ferry’s Astoria route stops at the Brooklyn Navy Yard just to the north, providing a waterborne commuter option that ties the area to waterfront job clusters in Brooklyn and Queens. As gentrification has accelerated in the 21st century, with a growing upper-middle-class population, the combination of strong transit, historic building stock, and nearby industrial and creative employment nodes has reinforced Clinton Hill’s role as a desirable mixed-use neighborhood with substantial cultural and educational institutions.
