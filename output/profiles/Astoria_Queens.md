### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A dense, highly mixed-use Queens neighborhood with active commercial corridors such as Steinway Street, 21st Street, Broadway, Ditmars Boulevard and Vernon Boulevard, combining retail, entertainment, cultural institutions, and legacy industrial uses.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Astoria retains a significant industrial and manufacturing legacy—most notably the Steinway & Sons piano factory and the heavily commercial Ravenswood waterfront—alongside major film/TV production campuses like Kaufman Astoria Studios and Silvercup Studios, and cultural draws such as the Museum of the Moving Image and Socrates Sculpture Park.


- **THE MARKET:** Covering about 2,556 acres with a population density of roughly 38,600 people per square mile, Astoria supports strong neighborhood retail, restaurant, and service demand, with commercial activity concentrated along major arterials and near transit, and continued relevance of industrial and power-generation uses in Ravenswood and along the East River.
