### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A dense, mixed-use Queens waterfront neighborhood with active commercial corridors such as Steinway Street, Vernon Boulevard, Broadway, 30th Avenue, and Ditmars Boulevard, plus studio and institutional anchors like Kaufman Astoria Studios, Silvercup Studios, Museum of the Moving Image, and the Steinway & Sons factory.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Legacy industrial and manufacturing assets in Ravenswood and around Steinway coexist with cultural destinations, beer gardens, sculpture parks, and waterfront esplanades that draw visitors and support a strong food, nightlife, and arts economy.


- **THE MARKET:** Astoria is commercially vibrant, with long-established retail strips, heavy foot traffic around subway nodes, significant industrial and power-generation uses in Ravenswood, and ongoing waterfront development such as the Halletts Point complex; zoning mixes industrial, commercial, and residential, and streets like 21st Street carry substantial vehicular volume.
