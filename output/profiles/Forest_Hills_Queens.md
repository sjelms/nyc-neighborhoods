### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Forest Hills is a centrally located Queens neighborhood with a strong commercial spine along Austin Street and significant additional retail activity on Queens Boulevard and Metropolitan Avenue, supported by dense mid- and high-rise apartment buildings and steady foot traffic from subway and LIRR riders.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Legacy destinations such as Forest Hills Stadium, the West Side Tennis Club, and antique-focused Metropolitan Avenue give the area an unusual blend of sports, entertainment, and specialty retail for a primarily residential district.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial assets cluster along Austin Street, Queens Boulevard, and near transit hubs, with zoning that historically allowed up to fifteen-story apartment buildings along Queens Boulevard, creating opportunities for ground-floor retail and service uses beneath large multifamily properties.

### Around the Block

Forest Hills supports a notably active commercial ecosystem anchored by several distinct corridors. Austin Street functions as the neighborhood’s commercial heart, described as a busy, modern mile-long stretch between Yellowstone Boulevard and Ascan Avenue, lined with shops, cafes, restaurants, chain stores, and other retail that draws visitors from surrounding neighborhoods. Queens Boulevard, the main thoroughfare, adds another layer of visibility and volume, with wide roadways and heavy traffic that support both neighborhood-serving and commuter-oriented retail uses. Metropolitan Avenue contributes an additional niche, being specifically known for its antique shops, which positions that corridor as a destination for specialty retail and resale concepts.

Transit access is a major driver of commercial viability in Forest Hills. The Queens Boulevard subway line provides multiple stations in and at the edges of the neighborhood—67th Avenue, Forest Hills–71st Avenue, 75th Avenue, and Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike—served by the E, F, M, R, and <F> trains. These stops, particularly the Forest Hills–71st Avenue express station, channel significant rider volumes directly onto nearby commercial blocks, supporting ground-floor retail, food and beverage, and services. The Forest Hills Long Island Rail Road station, integrated historically with a brick courtyard and arch-filled underpasses, supplies commuter rail access and further foot traffic, especially in the Station Square area. A large network of local and express buses, including the Q11, Q23, Q60, Q52/Q53 SBS, and numerous QM express routes to Midtown and Lower Manhattan, reinforces connectivity and expands the trade area of local businesses. Surrounding green spaces—Forest Park to the south and Flushing Meadows–Corona Park nearby—enhance recreational visitation, indirectly benefiting dining and retail clusters before and after park trips.
