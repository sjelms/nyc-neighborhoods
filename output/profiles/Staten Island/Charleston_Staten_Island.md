### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Charleston is a remote, low-density South Shore neighborhood where roughly one-third of the land is commercial and industrial, one-third residential, and one-third parkland, including Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve and the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** A historically industrial village built around the Kreischer Brick Manufactory now features large-format retail centers such as Bricktown Centre and other shopping plazas on Veterans Road West, alongside preserved historic assets like the landmark Kreischer mansion.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated along Veterans Road West, anchored by big-box retailers, an adult community development that incorporates the Kreischer mansion, and the Bricktown Commons shopping center that houses the city’s first net‑zero energy public library, while surrounding areas remain lightly built and park-adjacent.

### Around the Block

Charleston occupies a triangle-shaped territory on Staten Island’s South Shore, enclosed by Bloomingdale Road, the Richmond Parkway (Korean War Veterans Parkway), and the Arthur Kill. Historically, commercial activity was driven by the Kreischer Brick Manufactory, which supported the surrounding village then known as Kreischerville. That industrial legacy endures in the built environment, with the surviving Kreischer House landmark on Arthur Kill Road and a land-use mix that, as of 2002, was estimated to be one-third commercial and industrial, one-third residential, and one-third parkland. The presence of the closed Arthur Kill Correctional Facility further underscores the area’s institutional and non-residential footprint. Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve adds a substantial park component, shaping both development patterns and the appeal of nearby commercial and residential projects.

Recent decades have brought a pronounced retail and service-oriented shift in Charleston’s commercial profile. Veterans Road West has emerged as a primary shopping corridor, initially drawing destination retail with Staten Island’s first Target and a Home Depot within Bricktown Centre at Charleston, an open-air lifestyle center. A second shopping center has also been developed along Veterans Road West, and a ShopRite that opened there in 2016 remains the neighborhood’s only supermarket as of 2020, making this corridor a key provisioning hub. The Bricktown Commons shopping center also hosts the New York Public Library’s first net-zero energy branch, designed to operate almost entirely on solar power and programmed with multipurpose spaces for community use, adding an institutional anchor to the retail mix. Plans for a large 600,000-square-foot Riverside Galleria mall with a waterfront park and green roofs were ultimately canceled in 2019 following community opposition, signaling local sensitivity to large-scale commercial intensification. Parallel to the retail growth, age-restricted residential developments such as The Tides at Charleston and the planned Kreischerville Active Adult community, which preserves the Kreischer mansion as a centerpiece, link commercial amenities and historic preservation. Transit links via local and express buses, as well as proximity to major roadways like New York State Route 440 and the Korean War Veterans Parkway, support both existing retail and potential future commercial uses in this relatively remote section of New York City.
