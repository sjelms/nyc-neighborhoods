### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Mariner's Harbor is a North Shore Staten Island waterfront neighborhood with an active maritime and industrial presence along the Kill Van Kull and Richmond Terrace, including tugboat operators, dry docks, dredging firms, a cargo terminal, and freight rail service tied to the Howland Hook Marine Terminal.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Recent commercial investment, such as significant new shopping development along the Forest Avenue corridor from Lake Avenue to South Avenue and a modern NYPL branch designed to reflect the area’s oyster-harvesting past, adds contemporary services to a historically working-waterfront setting.


- **THE MARKET:** Legacy shipbuilding and heavy marine uses coexist with smaller industrial tenants in adaptive reuse space like the former Cross Paper Plant, while revitalized retail along Forest Avenue introduces higher-traffic commercial frontage in a predominantly working- and middle-class rental-heavy housing context.

### Around the Block

Mariner's Harbor sits on the northwestern edge of Staten Island with the Kill Van Kull as its working shoreline, and its commercial character is rooted in over a century of maritime and industrial use. Historically, this waterfront supported oyster harvesting and later evolved into a significant base for shipbuilding, repair, and marine salvage, with major players such as Bethlehem Steel controlling large stretches of land along Richmond Terrace. During World War II, Bethlehem’s Staten Island operations built U.S. Navy destroyers, anchoring a dense cluster of heavy industry and waterfront employment. That industrial legacy remains visible today in the form of dry docks, tugboat fleets, marine construction firms, and rail infrastructure connecting the neighborhood to larger regional freight networks.

The western portion of the former North Shore railway line has been rebuilt for freight service, enabling trains to move between New Jersey and the Howland Hook Marine Terminal in adjacent Port Ivory, directly reinforcing Mariner's Harbor’s role in port-related logistics. Current operators include tugboat companies K-Sea and McAllister, several smaller dry docks, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock, and the Mariners Harbor Cargo Terminal, all of which rely on deepwater access and industrial-zoned waterfront parcels. Inland, the former Cross Paper Plant has transitioned into rental space for small businesses, signaling a pattern of adaptive reuse where older industrial structures are repurposed rather than cleared. This is complemented by the construction of extensive shopping along Forest Avenue from Lake Avenue to South Avenue, which has revitalized a key retail corridor while also creating new traffic pressures on local roads. Community-serving institutions such as the Mariners Harbor branch of the New York Public Library and the West Shore Little League add foot traffic and daytime activity that support surrounding commercial uses. Together, waterfront marine operations, freight rail connectivity, adaptive reuse of legacy manufacturing sites, and a growing Forest Avenue retail spine define Mariner's Harbor as a hybrid industrial and service-oriented commercial district on Staten Island’s North Shore.
