### Around the Block

Rossville occupies a strategic section of Staten Island’s South Shore, sitting just inland from the Arthur Kill and adjacent to key road infrastructure. Historically a thriving farm and ferry village, the neighborhood’s commercial character has shifted over time from agriculture and water-based trade to a mix of residential density, local services, and marine-industrial uses. The completion of the West Shore Expressway in 1976, along with access to New York State Route 440, transformed the area’s connectivity and helped drive a sustained building boom. Longtime farmers sold land to developers, and much of the original building stock was replaced with large condominium and semi-detached home developments, increasing local demand for neighborhood retail and services.

Within Rossville, the Sandy Ground community represents a distinctive economic and cultural asset with roots in the oyster trade. Founded by free African Americans skilled in oyster harvesting, it historically leveraged proximity to Prince’s Bay, then the island’s main oyster hub. While oyster farming ended around 1916 due to harbor pollution, the legacy of this maritime economy remains visible through landmarked properties and the Sandy Ground Historical Society and Museum, which attract educational and heritage-focused visitation. On the waterfront, the Witte Marine Scrapyard—now the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility—anchors a notable industrial cluster along Arthur Kill Road. As one of the largest marine scrapyards on the East Coast, it handles obsolete tugs, ferries, and other vessels, providing specialized metal processing and storage. The scrapyard has also become a recognizable filming backdrop, adding niche media-production interest to its industrial role.

The heart of contemporary Rossville commerce is largely neighborhood-serving. A 26,000-square-foot shopping center at Rossville Avenue and Grafe Street, opened in 1992, provides a concentrated retail node supporting the nearby Woodbrooke Estates and Fawn Ridge condominium complexes, which together total over 1,100 residential units. These developments, built in the 1980s and early 1990s, define much of the area’s current built form and underpin consistent demand for everyday retail, services, and community facilities. Public services include a modern firehouse for FDNY Engine Company 168 and an FDNY EMS Battalion at Rossville Avenue and Veterans Road East, enhancing safety coverage for both residential and commercial properties. Bus routes on Bloomingdale Road and Rossville Avenue link the neighborhood to the Staten Island Railway at Pleasant Plains and to Manhattan via express buses, supporting workforce access for local institutions, schools, and industrial employers. Overall, Rossville now combines a suburbanized residential base, localized retail, and a distinctive marine-industrial edge shaped by its waterfront scrapyard and historic Sandy Ground community.
