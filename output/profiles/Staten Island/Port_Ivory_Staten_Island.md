### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Port Ivory is a heavily industrial coastal area centered on maritime terminals, legacy manufacturing sites, and limited residential presence.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area leverages deepwater access to Newark Bay, the Kill van Kull, and Arthur Kill, combined with freight rail connections and expressway access, creating strong intermodal logistics potential.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is dominated by port operations, warehouse and transshipment facilities, and former factory land being repurposed for rail and container terminal uses, with virtually no conventional retail corridors.

### Around the Block

Port Ivory occupies the northwestern tip of Staten Island as a coastal industrial zone oriented toward heavy maritime and freight activity. Historically known as Milliken, the district took on the Port Ivory name from the Procter & Gamble Ivory Soap plant that operated here from 1907 until 1991, anchoring the area’s manufacturing identity for most of the 20th century. That factory site remains commercially relevant, with portions now repurposed for freight infrastructure related to the nearby New York Container Terminal and the Howland Hook Marine Terminal. The waterfront location on Newark Bay, near the entrances to the Kill van Kull and Arthur Kill, positions Port Ivory as a strategic node for port-dependent businesses and logistics operators that require direct access to shipping channels. The neighborhood’s industrial character is underscored by the description of it as a heavily industrial area, with only a mobile home park along Goethals Road North and a small cluster of older single-family houses on Forest Avenue representing the limited residential footprint.

Modern commercial activity in Port Ivory centers on intermodal freight, marine terminal operations, and supporting logistics. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey leases the Howland Hook Marine Terminal and has contracted the construction of an intermodal rail yard on part of the former Ivory Soap factory site to enhance ship-to-rail transshipment capacity. Freight rail connectivity is provided by the North Shore branch of the Staten Island Railway, which crosses the Arthur Kill via the dedicated Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, running parallel to the Goethals Bridge and tying into Cranford Junction in New Jersey. Although freight use on this line had largely ceased by the early 1990s, efforts by the New York City Economic Development Corporation restored service in 2006, reconnecting the rebuilt Arlington Yard to the ExpressRail terminal at the marine terminal. This linkage strengthens the area’s role within the regional freight network by combining marine, rail, and road access in a compact geography. The Staten Island Expressway, sometimes cited as the southern boundary of Port Ivory, provides a major highway connection that supports truck access to port and industrial facilities, enhancing the viability of warehousing and transshipment operations in the district.
