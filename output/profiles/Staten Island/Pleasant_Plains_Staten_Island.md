### Around the Block

Pleasant Plains on Staten Island’s South Shore presents a commercial landscape that is modest in scale but historically rooted in transportation and institutional uses. The neighborhood’s identity grew out of the Staten Island Railway extension to Tottenville in 1860, when a station at Amboy Road was named Pleasant Plains and a community formed around it. This rail stop remains central to the area’s accessibility, anchoring the small business district along Amboy Road near Bloomingdale Road and Pleasant Plains Avenue. The MTA Staten Island Railway station, paired with local and express bus routes, sustains foot traffic that supports neighborhood-serving retail and services. The commercial core is described as experiencing a mild yet noticeable rebirth, consistent with patterns in other older South Shore nodes, suggesting incremental new tenants and reinvestment rather than large-scale redevelopment.

A defining feature of Pleasant Plains from a land-use perspective is the extensive Mount Loretto property and its evolution over time. Originally a vast farm and orphanage complex run by the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, it once contained what was at one time the largest farm in New York State. Portions of this historic institutional estate have transitioned into different non-residential uses: a large cemetery (the Cemetery of the Resurrection) on the north side of the property, and the Mount Loretto Unique Area, a state-managed park, on land south of Hylan Boulevard that extends to the waterfront. The park adjoins Lemon Creek Park and features a fishing pier at the foot of Sharrotts Avenue, as well as significant red clay bluffs overlooking Prince’s Bay and Outer New York Harbor. These environmental and recreational assets attract visitors and subtly support ancillary commercial demand, particularly for local food, services, and transit access. At the same time, sale of a 12-acre tract at the mission’s northeastern corner to residential developers in 2004 indicates ongoing pressure to convert institutional land to residential use, shaping future retail and service needs in the immediate commercial core.
