### Around the Block

Concourse is a key institutional and entertainment center in the southwestern Bronx, defined by its role as home to Yankee Stadium, the Bronx County Courthouse, and the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The Grand Concourse functions as the neighborhood’s primary spine, carrying subway service and bus routes that funnel visitors, workers, and game-day crowds directly into the area. Around the courthouse and 161st Street, civic buildings, plazas, and parks such as Joyce Kilmer Park and Lou Gehrig Plaza create a highly active public realm that supports office, legal, and service-oriented businesses. The longtime presence of Yankee Stadium—reinforced by the new ballpark opened in 2009—sustains a robust game-day economy, with surrounding blocks benefiting from pedestrian volume that supports food, beverage, and merchandise retail.

Along the Harlem River, the character becomes more industrial, with infrastructure and sites suited to logistics and larger-format commercial uses, offset by substantial public open space and the Bronx Terminal Market. Bronx Terminal Market, opened in 2009, operates as a large retail node drawing regional shoppers and integrating with nearby Mill Pond Park, which offers waterfront access and the Stadium Tennis Center. Additional commercial concentrations exist at Concourse Plaza and along 161st Street, as well as smaller retail clusters on 165th and 167th Streets, filling in the corridor with neighborhood services and storefront businesses. Transit accessibility is a major commercial asset, with the 4, B, and D subway lines, multiple Bx bus routes, and nearby Metro-North stations at Yankees–East 153rd Street and Melrose providing multi-modal access. Recent and planned investments, including the Bronx Hall of Justice, the Bronx Museum expansions, and a $300 million Harlem River redevelopment with a Universal Hip Hop Museum, performance space, movie theater, and a waterfront promenade, point toward continued institutional and visitor-driven activity. Together, these elements position Concourse as a mixed civic, cultural, and retail district with strong connectivity and growing waterfront and leisure-oriented uses layered onto an historically industrial edge.
