### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Rockaway Park’s commercial activity is concentrated along Beach 116th Street, a two-block corridor linking Beach Channel Drive and the Ocean Promenade and serving as the neighborhood’s main retail and service spine.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area’s commercial environment is reinforced by strong cultural identity, including a heavily Irish community presence and a major annual Saint Patrick’s Day parade that draws significant foot traffic to local businesses.


- **THE MARKET:** Rockaway Park benefits from direct subway, bus, and ferry links that channel visitors and commuters to the Beach 108th and Beach 116th Street nodes, supporting transit-oriented retail and service uses near the waterfront.

### Around the Block

Rockaway Park occupies a strategic position on the Rockaway Peninsula, with Jamaica Bay to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, giving its commercial core direct proximity to both bayfront and oceanfront activity. The neighborhood’s primary commercial axis is Beach 116th Street, a compact but important two-block segment running from Beach Channel Drive south to the Ocean Promenade. This spine acts as a focal point for neighborhood services, visitor-oriented retail, and seasonal beach-related commerce, benefitting from steady flows of residents, tourists, and day-trippers headed to the waterfront. At the northern end of this corridor, Tribute Park at Beach Channel Drive provides a landscaped public space that anchors nearby businesses and draws additional visitors. Memorials to the 343 firefighters killed on September 11 and to the 265 victims of American Airlines Flight 587 add a civic and commemorative dimension to the local streetscape and help define the area as more than just a beach town commercial strip.

Transportation infrastructure plays an outsized role in Rockaway Park’s commercial viability. The Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street station, terminal for the A and S subway services on the IND Rockaway Line, situates a major transit node directly at the heart of the retail corridor. Multiple bus routes intersect this area: the Q22 connects Beach 116th Street with other communities along the peninsula, while the Q53 SBS links Beach 116th Street to Woodside, including the Woodside LIRR station and 61st Street subway station, expanding access for both workers and customers. The Q35 bus ties Beach 108th Street to Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College in Brooklyn via the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge and Flatbush Avenue, passing through Belle Harbor, Neponsit, and Jacob Riis Park, and extending the trade area for Rockaway-serving businesses. Express service by the QM16 to and from Riis Park supplements this connectivity to Manhattan. Following Hurricane Sandy, ferry operations by SeaStreak and later NYC Ferry’s Rockaway route created a direct link between Beach 108th Street, Pier 11/Wall Street, and Brooklyn Army Terminal, reinforcing Beach 108th and 116th Streets as multi-modal hubs that support hospitality, retail, and other commercial uses.
