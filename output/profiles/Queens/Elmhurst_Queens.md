### Around the Block

Elmhurst functions as a major commercial hub in central Queens, defined by its mixed zoning and intense retail and service activity. Queens Boulevard cuts through as a wide, at-grade highway and primary artery, lined with commercial overlays and notable institutional buildings like the former Elks Lodge and the First Presbyterian Church of Newtown. The neighborhood’s land use pattern is unusually varied, with detached and multi-family houses interspersed with rowhouse districts, mid-rise apartment buildings, and large developments such as LeFrak City, creating a continuous customer base for local businesses. Several tracts are purpose-zoned for shopping centers, and these are occupied by some of Queens’ best-known malls, underlining Elmhurst’s role as a regional shopping destination.

The most prominent retail anchors are Queens Center and Queens Place Mall. Queens Center, bounded by Queens Boulevard, 57th and 59th Avenues, and 90th and 94th Streets, offers roughly 1,000,000 square feet of gross leasable area and has reported retail sales per square foot nearly triple the national average, making it a standout for national and international retailers. Nearby, the cylindrical Queens Place Mall, also fronting Queens Boulevard, adds another multi-tenant shopping complex on a site that was redesigned around a holdout property, later infilled with additional stores. Outside the enclosed malls, Broadway, Grand Avenue, and Corona Avenue host continuous ground-floor retail and services, including the rapidly growing Elmhurst Chinatown. This corridor, stretching along Broadway and expanding to Whitney and 45th Avenues, supports Chinese supermarkets, banks, and a wide range of Southeast Asian businesses, drawing customers from across Queens and beyond.

Transit access is a core enabler of Elmhurst’s commercial vibrancy. Multiple IND Queens Boulevard Line stations—Woodhaven Boulevard, Grand Avenue–Newtown, Elmhurst Avenue, and the nearby Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue complex—bring E, F, M, and R riders directly into the neighborhood’s shopping and service blocks. Along the northern edge, the 7 and 7 trains on the IRT Flushing Line stop at 74th Street–Broadway, 82nd Street–Jackson Heights, and 90th Street–Elmhurst Avenue, linking local businesses to dense residential districts and regional transfer points. The area is also bordered and traversed by the Long Island Expressway and Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, as well as major roads such as Woodhaven Boulevard, Junction Boulevard, Roosevelt Avenue, and Broadway, which connect Elmhurst to Manhattan, Jamaica, and both JFK and LaGuardia airports. This multimodal connectivity, combined with remaining light-manufacturing zones near the Port Washington Branch of the LIRR and a diverse workforce, positions Elmhurst as a strategic location for retail, neighborhood services, and small-scale industrial enterprises.
