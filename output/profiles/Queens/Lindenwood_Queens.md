### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Lindenwood is a mid-20th-century planned section of Howard Beach built on landfill, characterized by six-story co-op and condo elevator buildings, 1950s garden-style apartments visible from the Belt Parkway, and attached and semi-detached two-family homes from the 1960s.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The sub-neighborhood offers some of the earliest condominium product in New York State, a stable multifamily stock with converted recreational spaces, and proximity to major roadways and JFK Airport without a heavy industrial footprint.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated in the Lindenwood Shopping Center with a supermarket and roughly 20 stores, supported by additional strip retail on Linden Boulevard near the Lindenwood Diner and steady demand for co-op, condo, townhouse, and two-family housing.

### Around the Block

Lindenwood functions as a postwar, master-planned subdistrict within the broader Howard Beach area, developed in the 1950s and 1960s on landfill property as part of New Howard Beach. Its building stock is dominated by six-story orange- and red-brick elevator buildings constructed in the early to mid-1960s and smaller red-brick garden apartments from the 1950s that are visible from the Belt Parkway. Many of the high-rise buildings operate as cooperatives or condominiums, including Heritage House East and West, which are noted as among the first condominium apartments in New York State. The neighborhood’s residential density and uniform multifamily fabric create a consistent base of local consumers for retailers and service providers. Two-family homes, some attached, and later-added townhouses near the Brooklyn border round out the built environment, diversifying the housing product but maintaining a primarily low- to mid-rise character.

Commercially, Lindenwood is anchored by the Lindenwood Shopping Center, which includes a supermarket and about 20 stores, forming the core neighborhood retail node. This center has historically supported day-to-day needs for residents and provides a modest but stable customer base for small businesses. A second supermarket called “The Village” in the early 1970s went through several adaptive reuses—evolving into a mall, flea market, bingo hall, private school, and eventually a walk-in medical center—illustrating the area’s flexible approach to repositioning retail and community space as market needs change. Another small strip mall on Linden Boulevard, located next to the Lindenwood Diner, adds to the commercial mix and benefits from visibility on a major corridor. Former recreational assets, such as pool clubs and playgrounds around the apartment buildings, have largely been converted to apartments, townhouses, and sitting areas, indicating a long-term intensification and reconfiguration of land use. Transit access is primarily bus-based, including the B15 bus that makes one stop in Lindenwood before continuing to JFK Airport, connecting residents, workers, and visitors to the regional air hub and broader employment centers. In combination with nearby Belt Parkway frontage, these connections support both local commerce and the viability of neighborhood-serving retail.
