### Around the Block

Kew Gardens Hills presents a layered commercial landscape shaped by transportation infrastructure, institutional uses, and legacy residential developments that generate steady foot traffic. The primary commercial spine is Main Street, identified as one of the shopping centers of the neighborhood and lined with numerous Jewish-themed stores and kosher restaurants. Many of these Main Street businesses close for Shabbat, signaling a retail pattern that closely follows the rhythms of the area’s large Orthodox Jewish population. Additional retail and service activity extends along Union Turnpike, Parsons Boulevard, and Kissena Boulevard, forming secondary corridors that serve local residents, students, and workers from nearby schools and colleges.

Institutional uses play an outsized role in the neighborhood’s commercial ecosystem. Queens College, part of the CUNY system and located in the northern portion of Kew Gardens Hills, anchors a cluster of cultural facilities including the Godwin-Ternbach Museum and the Selma and Max Kupferberg Center for the Visual and Performing Arts. These draw visitors from beyond the immediate area and support demand for food, services, and convenience retail nearby. Large educational and religious institutions such as Lander College for Men, Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim, Yeshivas Ohr HaChaim, numerous synagogues, and other houses of worship also bring consistent daytime and evening populations to the streets. Garden apartment complexes like Regency Gardens and the Electchester co-operative, as well as the sizable Parkway Village community, concentrate thousands of residents within walking distance of the commercial strips. At the same time, sections of Kissena Boulevard have experienced permanent business closures during economic downturns, underscoring that not all corridors perform equally. Overall, Kew Gardens Hills combines stable, institution-driven demand with auto and bus accessibility via nearby expressways and major arterials, creating a neighborhood-scale but diverse commercial environment.
