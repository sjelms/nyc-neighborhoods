### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Astoria is a dense, mixed-use Queens neighborhood on the East River with significant commercial corridors such as Steinway Street, Broadway, 30th Avenue, Ditmars Boulevard, and 21st Street supporting retail, services, and dining, alongside legacy industrial and manufacturing uses, including the long‑running Steinway & Sons factory and the heavily commercial Ravenswood waterfront.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area’s historic role in filmmaking and media, anchored by Kaufman Astoria Studios and the Museum of the Moving Image, combines with diverse ethnic commercial strips like “Little Egypt” on Steinway Street to create an unusually strong cluster of cultural, culinary, and creative businesses for an outer‑borough neighborhood.


- **THE MARKET:** Covering 2,556.2 acres with a population density of 60.3 inhabitants per acre, Astoria’s sizable customer base supports a broad mix of neighborhood retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses, while waterfront power generation, industrial sites in Ravenswood, and institutional uses around parks and cemeteries occupy much of the remaining non‑residential land.

### Around the Block

Astoria sits in western Queens along the East River, where a long history of industry and transportation still shapes its commercial landscape. The neighborhood evolved from Hallet’s Cove into an industrial and manufacturing hub in the 19th century, driven by German furniture and cabinet makers and, most prominently, the Steinway & Sons piano company. Steinway not only built a factory complex but also a sawmill, foundry, and streetcar line, and developed Steinway Village as a company town. These investments set a pattern of employment‑oriented land use that continues today in and around the Steinway plant at 1 Steinway Place and in the adjacent Steinway and Ditmars subsections. Ravenswood, the strip along the East River south of Astoria Park, became heavily commercial by 1900 and remains so, with historic mansions long since converted to offices and boarding houses and later replaced by more intensive commercial buildings.

Modern Astoria retains significant industrial and infrastructure assets, most notably the Ravenswood Generating Station, including the “Big Allis” unit, which can provide about 20 percent of New York City’s electricity demand. These heavy uses coexist with cultural and media institutions that have repurposed older industrial and studio buildings, such as Kaufman Astoria Studios and the Museum of the Moving Image. The area around 35th Avenue and the studio complex supports film, television, and related creative businesses, underlining Astoria’s legacy as an early American filmmaking center. Retail corridors run along Steinway Street, a major commercial spine lined with shops and services, and along Broadway, 30th Avenue, and Ditmars Boulevard, which support numerous ethnic restaurants, bakeries, and cafes. Steinway Street between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard hosts “Little Egypt,” a dense cluster of Arabic shops, restaurants, and cafes that functions as both a neighborhood amenity and regional draw.

Astoria’s waterfront and open spaces also play a commercial role. Astoria Park and the Halletts Point Esplanade, developed alongside large residential projects by The Durst Organization, generate demand for nearby retail and food businesses while offering vistas of the Hell Gate Bridge and Manhattan skyline. Socrates Sculpture Park and Rainey Park add to the recreational and cultural destinations that support visitor‑serving uses along Vernon Boulevard. Transit access is robust, with multiple N and W line subway stations running up 31st Street, and M and R stations along 36th and 46th Streets, feeding foot traffic to surrounding blocks of storefronts. Numerous bus routes, including the M60 SBS to LaGuardia Airport and Manhattan, and several lines connecting to Queensboro Plaza and Court Square, improve connectivity for both workers and customers. Ferry service on the Astoria route further enhances regional accessibility for waterfront‑adjacent commercial properties. Together, these elements create a neighborhood where industrial infrastructure, media production, and diverse small businesses operate side by side in a dense, transit‑rich environment.
