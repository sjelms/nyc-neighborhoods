### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Richmond Hill is a mixed-use Queens neighborhood with several active commercial corridors along Jamaica Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, and Liberty Avenue, complemented by surrounding low- to mid-density residential stock.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its commercial streets reflect strong South Asian, Indo-Caribbean, and Punjabi cultural influences, including the branded Little Guyana and Little Punjab retail stretches, and a concentration of diverse religious institutions that draw regional visitors.


- **THE MARKET:** The market features stable neighborhood-serving retail, medical office conversions of historic buildings near the Richmond Hill Triangle, legacy entertainment properties such as a former RKO theater now used as a bingo hall, and rail-adjacent parcels influenced by the Long Island Rail Road’s Montauk Branch freight right-of-way and proximity to the Van Wyck Expressway.

### Around the Block

Richmond Hill’s commercial framework is anchored by three primary corridors: Jamaica Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, and Liberty Avenue. Historically, the area around the “Richmond Hill Triangle,” bracketed by Jamaica Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, and 117th Street, functioned as the neighborhood’s commercial center and still concentrates key properties. Notable among these are the former Triangle Hofbrau hotel and restaurant—now converted to medical offices—and the former RKO Keith’s Richmond Hill Theater between Myrtle Avenue and the Montauk Line railroad, which has operated as a bingo hall since 1968. These examples of adaptive reuse illustrate how older hospitality and entertainment buildings continue to generate foot traffic and neighborhood employment while serving contemporary service and healthcare uses. The area’s commercial identity is further reinforced by James J. Creegan Square at the intersection of Jamaica and Myrtle Avenues and multiple active institutional anchors such as schools, churches, and public facilities clustered nearby.

Liberty Avenue and 101st Avenue carry an additional layer of ethnic and cultural commerce. A portion of Liberty Avenue has been officially renamed Little Guyana, reflecting a dense Indo-Caribbean business presence, while 101st Avenue has evolved into “Little Punjab” or Punjab Avenue, associated with Richmond Hill’s large Sikh and broader Punjabi population. These corridors host a wide variety of South Asian and Indo-Caribbean retail and services, drawing customers from across Queens and beyond. The neighborhood’s commercial ecosystem is supported by strong transit connectivity: J and Z subway stations at 104th and 121st Streets, the J at 111th Street, E service at Jamaica–Van Wyck, and A service at 111th Street and Ozone Park–Lefferts Boulevard all bring workers and customers to the area. Numerous local bus routes and an express bus to Manhattan further expand the catchment area for retailers. The Long Island Rail Road’s Montauk Branch runs diagonally through the neighborhood and provides freight access, underscoring Richmond Hill’s continued logistical relevance even after closure of the former Richmond Hill LIRR passenger station. Meanwhile, the Van Wyck Expressway at the eastern edge enhances vehicular access for goods movement and regional customers visiting the neighborhood’s diverse commercial strips.
