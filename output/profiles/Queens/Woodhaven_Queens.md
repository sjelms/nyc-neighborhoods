### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Woodhaven is a semi-suburban Queens neighborhood with a clearly defined commercial spine along Jamaica Avenue and additional retail along Atlantic Avenue at the southern border.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its historic commercial strip features long-running, locally owned businesses, legacy taverns, and restaurant and candy shop operators that have remained in place for decades, giving the corridor a distinctive small-town main-street character.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated in mixed-use strips on Jamaica Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, characterized by small storefront retail and food service tenants, with most surrounding blocks maintained as low-density residential under more restrictive land-use patterns.

### Around the Block

Woodhaven’s commercial identity is anchored by Jamaica Avenue, a longstanding west–east artery that effectively bisects the neighborhood and concentrates most of its retail and service activity. This corridor evolved from the Old Rockaway Trail into the neighborhood’s main thoroughfare, with elevated subway service above it since 1918 via the BMT Jamaica Line. Today, Jamaica Avenue hosts a large number of small, locally owned stores and restaurants, many of which have operated for generations. Longtime establishments such as Popp’s Restaurant (opened 1907), Manor Delicatessen (opened 1914), and Schmidt’s Candy (opened 1925 and still family‑run) illustrate the stability of small business tenancy in the area. Neir’s Tavern, originally opened in 1829 and often cited among the city’s oldest bars, remains a key commercial and cultural landmark, drawing both neighborhood patrons and visitors. The continued presence of these legacy operators supports a commercial environment that skews toward independent retailers rather than national chains, helping maintain a distinctive streetscape and customer base.

Historically, Woodhaven also developed as a manufacturing and hospitality node, with racetrack-era hotels such as the Snedeker Hotel and Forschback Inn built to serve large racing crowds at nearby Union Course. Later, the Lalance & Grosjean Tin Manufacturing Factory positioned Woodhaven as a manufacturing community, producing kitchen and household objects important enough to appear in Museum of Modern Art design exhibitions. While that specific industrial use is no longer active, it illustrates a legacy of light manufacturing and employment-generating uses in the area. Dexter Park once added a sports and entertainment dimension, hosting professional Negro League baseball and pioneering engineered night-game lighting, which helped draw visitors and related commercial traffic. Transit infrastructure has long shaped Woodhaven’s commercial prospects: horse-drawn and then electrified Long Island Rail Road service on Atlantic Avenue created early commuter and visitor flows; the now-closed Woodhaven Junction station linked the neighborhood to Jamaica, Brooklyn’s Atlantic Terminal, and the Rockaway Beach Branch. Today, the J and Z trains along Jamaica Avenue and multiple Q and express bus routes keep Woodhaven connected to regional job centers and consumers. Proposals to reopen the Rockaway Beach Branch or convert it to a rail trail underscore the ongoing role of transit corridors in framing future commercial opportunities and foot traffic patterns for Woodhaven’s business strips.
