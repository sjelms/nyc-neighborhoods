## Ozone Park

Ozone Park is a neighborhood in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of Queens, New York, United States. It is next to the Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, a popular spot for Thoroughbred racing and home to the Resorts World Casino & Hotel. Home to a large Italian-American population, Ozone Park has also grown in recent decades to have many residents of Caribbean, Hispanic, and Asian backgrounds.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Ozone Park is a southwestern Queens neighborhood with strong transit access and several busy commercial corridors, including Liberty Avenue, Rockaway Boulevard, Cross Bay Boulevard and 101st Avenue that support dense retail and service businesses alongside lowrise housing.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Proximity to Aqueduct Racetrack and the Resorts World Casino & Hotel, plus adaptive reuse of historic industrial assets like the Lalance & Grosjean factory complex into a medical clinic, add entertainment and institutional demand beyond typical neighborhood retail.


- **THE MARKET:** Land values and construction boomed historically with the arrival of rail and major arterials such as Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards; today the area’s stable, diverse population and auto and transit access support neighborhood-serving retail, small-scale commercial uses, and some legacy industrial and cemetery tracts.

### Around the Block

Ozone Park sits in southwestern Queens with a land-use pattern shaped by transportation infrastructure and a long history of suburban-style development tied to transit. Early economic activity centered on the Lalance & Grosjean factory complex near Atlantic Avenue and 92nd Street, which anchored worker housing and established an industrial presence in the area. Although the factory closed in the 1960s, its landmarked clock-tower complex has been adaptively reused as a medical clinic, maintaining an institutional-commercial role on a legacy manufacturing site. Cemeteries such as Mokom Sholom and Bayside Cemetery occupy substantial tracts between 80th and 84th Streets from Liberty to Pitkin Avenues, forming a distinctive nonresidential landscape with periodic attention from media and philanthropic restoration efforts.

Commercially, Ozone Park’s growth has been tied to improving access. The opening of the Rockaway Beach Branch station in the 1880s and the 1915 Fulton Street elevated line over Liberty Avenue made the district more attractive for commuters and shoppers, and Liberty Avenue subsequently emerged as a key spine for storefronts and services. In the 1920s, the widening of Woodhaven Avenue to 150 feet and its renaming as Woodhaven Boulevard, plus the construction of Cross Bay Boulevard down to the Rockaway Peninsula, dramatically increased automobile access, triggered a construction boom, and raised land values. These arterials, together with Rockaway Boulevard and North and South Conduit Avenues, still function as major vehicular corridors linking local merchants to customers from adjacent neighborhoods and to the Belt Parkway corridor nearby. The Aqueduct Racetrack, now paired with the Resorts World Casino & Hotel in adjacent South Ozone Park, acts as a regional draw at the southern edge, supporting hospitality, food-and-beverage, and convenience retail demand. Within Ozone Park’s subsections—Centreville, Liberty Heights, Balsam Village, Tudor Village and others—small clusters like “Tudor Malls” provide local retail and services, illustrating a pattern of neighborhood-scale commercial nodes embedded within a primarily lowrise built form. Transit connectivity via the A train and numerous bus routes ensures steady foot traffic for these corridors and helps sustain a diverse mix of small businesses serving Caribbean, Hispanic, South Asian, Italian-American and other communities.
