## East Elmhurst

East Elmhurst is a residential neighborhood in the northwest section of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bounded to the south by Jackson Heights and Corona, to the north and east by Bowery Bay, and to the west by Woodside and Ditmars Steinway. The area also includes LaGuardia Airport, located on the shore of Flushing Bay, LaGuardia Landing Lights Fields, and Astoria Heights (the latter two in ZIP Code 11370).

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** East Elmhurst contains LaGuardia Airport, the Bulova Corporate Center, and several neighborhood retail and institutional corridors along Astoria Boulevard, Ditmars Boulevard, Northern Boulevard, and 31st Avenue, serving a largely residential catchment with airport-related and community-serving uses.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Historic aviation infrastructure such as the Marine Air Terminal and the former Bulova Watch Company headquarters repurposed as an office center give the neighborhood an aviation-and-industry legacy alongside waterfront access to Flushing Bay and multiple parks and promenades.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is concentrated in and around LaGuardia Airport, along major boulevards, and in legacy properties like Bulova Corporate Center, with additional opportunities tied to institutional users such as Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, schools, places of worship, and neighborhood retail strips.

### Around the Block

East Elmhurst in northwest Queens is defined commercially by its proximity to LaGuardia Airport and a network of major arterials that move both people and goods. The neighborhood includes LaGuardia itself, a major regional employer and transportation hub located along Flushing Bay, with the historic Marine Air Terminal recognized as a New York City designated landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. Aviation has long shaped land use here: the former North Beach and Holmes airports preceded LaGuardia, and today the Bulova Corporate Center, on the site of the former Grand Central Air Terminal, stands as a substantial office complex that houses, among other tenants, the New York City Department of Correction headquarters. These airport-related facilities bring a steady daytime population and associated demand for services, logistics support, and hospitality-oriented businesses, even though the surrounding blocks remain predominantly low-scale and residential.

Commercial corridors follow the neighborhood’s broad east–west routes. Astoria Boulevard, Ditmars Boulevard, and Northern Boulevard function as primary spines, carrying vehicular traffic near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (I-278) and the Grand Central Parkway and providing visibility and access for storefronts and service businesses. Smaller avenues such as 31st and 32nd Avenues host institutions like the Lexington School and Center for the Deaf, Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School, and numerous houses of worship, all of which anchor localized foot traffic. Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, located along 23rd Avenue abutting the Grand Central Parkway, injects a specialized student and professional population tied directly to aviation and technical trades. St. Michael’s Cemetery occupies a large, triangular tract framed by major highways, acting as a long-established land use adjacent to residential and commercial fabric. The Flushing Bay Promenade, now renamed Malcolm X Promenade, together with parks like LaGuardia Landing Lights Fields and Planeview Park, creates a waterfront edge that is recreational in character but highly influenced by airport operations. Although there is no direct subway service, an extensive bus network and highway infrastructure support circulation and make East Elmhurst accessible to airport workers, office users, and neighborhood-serving businesses alike.
