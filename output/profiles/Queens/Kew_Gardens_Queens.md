### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Kew Gardens features a compact commercial core around Lefferts Boulevard, Metropolitan Avenue, Austin Street, and Kew Gardens Road, supported by dense mid-rise multifamily housing and civic uses such as Queens Borough Hall and a county criminal court complex.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood’s proximity to Forest Park, major courts, and two airports draws a mix of legal professionals, airline personnel, and local retailers, sustaining a walkable business district that benefits from strong transit connectivity and through-traffic at the Kew Gardens Interchange.


- **THE MARKET:** Queens Boulevard rezoning near the subway enabled higher-density apartment construction and helped create a thriving business district marketed as part of the ‘Golden Area,’ with continued demand for multifamily conversions, hotel use, and street-level retail serving a diverse, relatively stable, middle-income population.

### Around the Block

Kew Gardens presents a commercially anchored, transit-served node in central Queens, with its activity concentrated along Lefferts Boulevard between Austin Street and Metropolitan Avenue and extending onto Kew Gardens Road and Queens Boulevard. The area evolved from a planned garden community into a higher-density hub once the Queens Boulevard subway line and express stations were completed, driving both apartment construction and retail demand. Real estate speculation around the subway’s arrival led to rezoning for fifteen-story buildings near Queens Boulevard, laying the groundwork for today’s concentration of multifamily stock and ground-floor commercial uses. These corridors now host locally owned businesses and restaurants, along with specialty offerings such as the 1930s-era Kew Gardens Cinemas, which has been adapted into a six-screen multiplex showing commercial, independent, and foreign films. The neighborhood also contains the only bookstore in central Queens, Kew & Willow Books, further strengthening its role as a local destination for services and culture.

Institutional and governmental uses are key to the commercial ecosystem. Queens Borough Hall and one of the county criminal courts occupy a large complex on Queens Boulevard between Union Turnpike and Hoover Avenue, bringing a steady daytime population of public employees, attorneys, jurors, and visitors. The courthouse is described as very profitable and, together with strong transportation access, serves as a significant locational draw even if the direct revenues do not flow to the neighborhood itself. JetBlue formerly headquartered at 80-02 Kew Gardens Road, and Saudi Arabian Airlines maintains an office in the same building, illustrating the area’s appeal for airline- and travel-related users given its connectivity to JFK and LaGuardia. Many pilots and flight attendants stay in Kew Gardens between flights, supported by a recently completed hotel on 82nd Avenue and by frequent Q10 bus service to John F. Kennedy International Airport, as well as dedicated airline shuttles. The Kew Gardens LIRR station and the Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike subway station provide regional access, while the convergence of the Van Wyck Expressway, Grand Central Parkway, Jackie Robinson Parkway, Queens Boulevard, and Union Turnpike at the Kew Gardens Interchange makes the neighborhood highly accessible by car and attractive for service, hospitality, and professional-office users.
