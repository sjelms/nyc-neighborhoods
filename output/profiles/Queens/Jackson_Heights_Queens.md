### Around the Block

Jackson Heights functions as a major neighborhood commercial center in northwestern Queens, anchored by a historic planned community and several intense retail corridors. The core business district runs along 37th Avenue from 72nd Street to Junction Boulevard, with additional retail on 73rd, 74th, and 82nd streets between 37th and Roosevelt avenues. These blocks mix grocery stores, specialty food shops, national chains, and small independent operators in prewar buildings, many of which fall inside the Jackson Heights Historic District. Architecturally distinctive Tudor-style properties on 82nd Street host national retailers, illustrating how landmark protections coexist with contemporary chain tenancy. Roosevelt Avenue and Northern Boulevard add long, continuous fronts of ground-floor commercial spaces, with Roosevelt skewing heavily Hispanic and Northern Boulevard east of 80th Street dominated by South American—particularly Colombian and Peruvian—eateries and retailers.

The neighborhood’s commerce is closely tied to a globally diverse population and to transit. The Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street station is a major intermodal hub where the 7, E, F, M, and R trains intersect with multiple bus routes including the Q32, Q33, Q47, Q49, Q53 SBS, and Q70 SBS. This connectivity draws shoppers from across Queens and from LaGuardia Airport, sustaining intensive restaurant and small-retail activity on 74th Street’s Little India, 73rd Street’s Little Pakistan and Little Bangladesh, and the surrounding blocks. Street vending is a major component of the local economy: along Roosevelt Avenue from 74th to 108th Streets, food carts offer products from Mexican tamales and elotes to Bengali fuchka, Nepalese momo, Colombian arepas, and other global fare. This concentration has attracted media attention and culinary tourism, further reinforcing foot traffic. The area has also seen corporate and institutional tenants: RCN TV, a major Colombian broadcaster, maintains its U.S. headquarters in the neighborhood, and the Victor A. Moore Bus Terminal represents a substantial MTA capital investment, including one of the system’s first green buildings. Between 2009 and 2018, Jackson Heights recorded a 72% increase in taxable business sales and a 25% increase in total businesses, underscoring its role as a growing commercial hub rather than merely a bedroom community.

While Jackson Heights originated as a high-elevation garden apartment enclave on filled marshland, most of the surviving garden-city fabric has been incorporated into the Jackson Heights Historic District, which now includes over 2,200 contributing buildings. These landmark controls, along with a strong residential base, help stabilize demand for neighborhood-serving retail. At the same time, legacy entertainment properties such as historic movie theaters have been repurposed into restaurants and a food court, reflecting ongoing adaptive reuse of older structures for contemporary commercial uses. The combination of protected architecture, robust transit access, and a dense, multicultural customer base positions Jackson Heights as a durable location for small-scale retail, food and beverage operators, and service businesses oriented to both local residents and regional visitors.
