## Flushing

Flushing is a neighborhood in the north-central portion of the New York City borough of Queens. The neighborhood is the fourth-largest central business district in New York City. Downtown Flushing is a major commercial and retail area, with the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue at its core being the third-busiest in New York City, behind Times Square and Herald Square.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Flushing is Queens’ fourth-largest central business district, with a dense, transit-oriented commercial core centered on Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue and supported by substantial bus, subway, and LIRR access.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area combines one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing Chinatowns and a significant Koreatown with historic landmarks, cultural institutions, and regional shopping malls, creating strong year-round foot traffic and destination dining and retail activity.


- **THE MARKET:** Downtown Flushing is a major outer-borough retail and services hub with multilevel malls, mixed-use projects, and highly competitive Asian-oriented businesses, while surrounding subsections vary from high-density multifamily cooperatives to lower-density residential areas that have been rezoned to preserve character, limiting large-scale new development there.

### Around the Block

Flushing functions as a powerful commercial engine for Queens and much of northern Long Island, anchored by one of New York City’s busiest intersections at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue. This core is the center of Flushing Chinatown, often called the Chinese Times Square or Chinese Manhattan, and supports an extensive ecosystem of Chinese and Korean restaurants, supermarkets, education centers, bookstores, banks, consumer electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other retail and service businesses. The presence of multiple Chinese and Korean media outlets, cram schools, and social service organizations reinforces Flushing’s role as a regional hub for the Asian-American community and continually refreshes customer demand. The market remained resilient even through the Covid-19 period, with business activity in Downtown Flushing continuing to flourish, particularly in food and specialty retail. 

Major mixed-use projects and malls consolidate this demand into large-format retail footprints. Properties such as New World Mall, Queens Crossing, One Fulton Square, The Shops at Skyview Center, Flushing Commons, and Tangram bring together shopping, food halls, entertainment, and in some cases residential or condominium components, intensifying both daytime and evening traffic. The Shops at Skyview Center, for example, pairs a mall with a condo development stacked above, while Tangram includes a food hall, a children’s swim school, and Queens’ first 4DX movie theater, enhancing family-oriented and leisure spending. These complexes cluster around the transit spine and key arterials like Roosevelt Avenue and College Point Boulevard, benefiting from heavy pedestrian and vehicular flows.

Transit access is a defining commercial advantage. The terminus of the IRT Flushing Line (7 and 7 trains) at Flushing–Main Street is one of the subway system’s busiest stations, funneling riders directly into the downtown retail grid. Three Long Island Rail Road stations on the Port Washington Branch—Flushing–Main Street, Murray Hill, and Broadway—extend the trade area deep into eastern Queens and Nassau County. An extensive bus network, including routes such as the Q12, Q13, Q17, Q20, Q25, Q44 SBS, Q50, and Q58, and NICE routes like the n20G and n20x, connects Flushing to Jamaica, Queensboro Plaza, LaGuardia Airport, and multiple suburban nodes. Highways including the Van Wyck Expressway, Whitestone Expressway (I-678), Grand Central Parkway, and Long Island Expressway (I-495), along with major corridors like Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, provide strong regional road access for customers, employees, and logistics. Surrounding subsections such as Broadway–Flushing, Linden Hill, Queensboro Hill, Pomonok, and Waldheim are more residential but feed consumer demand into the downtown core, with large co-op complexes like Linden Hill and Electchester adding stable, nearby population bases that support neighborhood retail strips and services.
