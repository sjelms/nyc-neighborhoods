### Around the Block

Steinway sits within Astoria, a historically industrial and commercial district in western Queens that has evolved into a dense, mixed-use neighborhood with strong retail and cultural anchors. Astoria’s east–west and north–south corridors support a sizable base of street-level businesses that draw on heavy local and regional foot traffic. Steinway Street in particular is identified as a major commercial street with many retail stores, and the broader Steinway area is recognized as the eastern end of Astoria, sometimes simply called “Steinway” in common usage. This naming reflects the long-standing influence of Steinway & Sons, whose piano factory at 1 Steinway Place has operated since the late 19th century and once anchored the stand‑alone Steinway Village company town for its workforce. Nearby, 21st Street functions as a major traffic artery with a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, helping move goods, employees, and customers through the neighborhood.

Historically, economic and commercial growth in Astoria was tied to manufacturing and industrial enterprises that attracted immigrant labor and supported a constellation of small businesses. The Steinway family not only built their factory but also supported local infrastructure, including a sawmill, foundry, and a streetcar line, reinforcing the area’s role as a production and employment hub. While much of Long Island City to the south retained an industrial reputation, many businesses north of Broadway embraced the Astoria and Steinway identities to align with a more mixed-use and culturally vibrant brand. Today, commercial and cultural assets such as Kaufman Astoria Studios, the Museum of the Moving Image, the Noguchi Museum, and various historic industrial buildings contribute to a creative economy that complements traditional retail along Steinway Street and adjacent avenues. Waterfront parks like Astoria Park and Socrates Sculpture Park enhance the area’s appeal to visitors and workers, supporting hospitality and leisure-related businesses. The neighborhood’s ethnic diversity—spanning Greek, Arab, Balkan, Latin American, and other communities—sustains a wide variety of restaurants, cafes, specialty grocers, and services, reinforcing Steinway and its surroundings as a dynamic commercial environment with strong local demand and regional draw.
