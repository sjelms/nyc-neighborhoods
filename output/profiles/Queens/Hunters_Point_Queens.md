### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Hunters Point, on the south side of Long Island City along Newtown Creek and the East River waterfront, mixes historic townhouse blocks with large-scale waterfront developments like Queens West and Hunter's Point South, and sits near major industrial and commercial corridors such as 21st Street and Borden Avenue.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area juxtaposes a designated historic district of 19th‑century townhouses with contemporary residential towers, adaptive reuse of former factories into production studios and offices, and proximity to waterfront parks that improve the environment for street-level retail and service businesses.


- **THE MARKET:** Historically industrial and still influenced by nearby manufacturing and logistics uses, Hunters Point now benefits from the broader Long Island City rezoning and gentrification, with ongoing high‑rise waterfront development, a growing business improvement district reach, and strong transit and ferry access supporting mixed commercial and residential demand.

### Around the Block

Hunters Point occupies the southern portion of Long Island City, fronting Newtown Creek and the East River, and has long been shaped by industry, transport, and waterfront access. Historically, maps show an industrial Hunters Point in the late 19th century, reflecting the neighborhood’s strategic position along canalized Newtown Creek, which intensified industrial development across adjoining areas like Dutch Kills and Blissville. This legacy is still visible in the broader Long Island City context, where 21st Street remains mostly industrial and commercial, and major arterials such as the Long Island Expressway, Queens Boulevard, Northern Boulevard/Jackson Avenue, and Vernon Boulevard thread heavy commuter and freight traffic through the district. The modern Hunters Point waterfront has been transformed through master-planned projects such as Queens West and Hunter’s Point South, which occupy former industrial land along the East River. These developments sit just north of the Long Island City LIRR terminal and near the Hunterspoint Avenue LIRR station, positioning the area as a multimodal node where rail, subway, and ferry converge to support daytime employment and ground-floor commercial uses.

The wider Long Island City market surrounding Hunters Point is defined by extensive adaptive reuse of former factories and bakeries into creative production, institutional, and office space. Assets such as the former Silvercup bakery, now Silvercup Studios, and the Standard Motor Products Building, now hosting tenants like the Jim Henson Company and Society Awards along with a commercial rooftop farm, illustrate a shift from heavy manufacturing to media, design, and specialty production. The nearby Brewster Building anchors JetBlue’s headquarters, while LaGuardia Community College occupies repurposed industrial buildings, stabilizing daytime population and service demand. The Long Island City Business Improvement District, initiated around Queens Plaza and expanded multiple times through 2024, reflects increasing investment in streetscape, maintenance, and business support for corridors that serve Hunters Point, including access routes to the waterfront parks at Hunters Point South and Gantry Plaza State Park. Transit connectivity is a core commercial asset: multiple subway lines (7, E, F, M, G, N, W, R), two LIRR stations, and NYC Ferry’s Hunters Point South stop feed both office and retail traffic. The area’s evolution from industrial waterfront to mixed-use district, while still bordered by active infrastructure and industrial zones along Newtown Creek, makes Hunters Point a hybrid environment where legacy industry, large-scale residential towers, cultural institutions, and local services can co-locate and draw on excellent access to Manhattan and Brooklyn markets.
