### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** St. Albans is a predominantly low-density, residential section of southeast Queens with commercial activity concentrated along Linden Boulevard, the neighborhood’s major shopping street, and additional retail clustered around the historic Linden Boulevard–Farmers Boulevard crossroads.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Roy Wilkins Park and St. Albans Park, both on former institutional land including a naval/VA hospital site, provide sizable recreational assets that support community programming and events, while the Addisleigh Park historic district adds cultural cachet linked to its jazz and civil-rights legacy.


- **THE MARKET:** The built environment is dominated by detached one- and two-family homes, with some neighborhood-serving retail strips and limited larger commercial or institutional footprints such as the Veterans Administration St. Albans Primary and Extended Care Facility.

### Around the Block

St. Albans in southeast Queens is framed by a network of key arterials and a long history of incremental development from farmland to a transit-served urban neighborhood. Its contemporary commercial heart orients around Linden Boulevard, identified as the major shopping street, and the intersection of Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, which historically drew the first wave of local shops around August Everitt’s store. Today these corridors function as the primary neighborhood-serving retail spine, anchoring small-format storefronts and services that cater to local residents rather than destination shoppers. Merrick Boulevard also plays a visible role, with civic and service uses such as a firehouse and proximity to St. Albans Park, contributing to foot traffic and local demand. The presence of multiple post offices nearby, including the Saint Albans Station on Linden Boulevard, further supports day-to-day activity along these corridors.

Institutional and recreational land uses occupy a notable share of St. Albans and help shape local commercial patterns. The neighborhood’s major institutional anchor is the Veterans Administration St. Albans Primary and Extended Care Facility, the contemporary iteration of the former St. Albans Naval Hospital complex, which once contained 3,000 beds and 76 wards. Part of that former federal site was converted into Roy Wilkins Park, a large multi-sport recreation area with facilities for baseball, basketball, cricket, tennis, swimming, and track-and-field, plus a recreation center. Together with St. Albans Park and several smaller playgrounds and nature areas, these parks generate steady, seasonal demand for convenience retail, food, and services nearby. St. Albans lies about two miles north of John F. Kennedy International Airport, positioning it within a broader southeast Queens employment and logistics belt even though the neighborhood itself is primarily residential. Transit connectivity is driven by numerous MTA bus routes—many feeding into Jamaica Center and Jamaica’s subway and Long Island Rail Road hubs—and by the LIRR’s St. Albans station on the Atlantic Branch, enabling commuter flows that support local retail while tying the area into regional labor and consumer markets. Addisleigh Park, a historic single-family enclave within St. Albans, adds a layer of prestige and cultural tourism interest through its concentration of former jazz, sports, and civil-rights figures, indirectly reinforcing the neighborhood’s profile and long-term demand for stable neighborhood-serving commercial uses.
