### Around the Block

Auburndale sits in northern Queens between Bayside and Murray Hill, positioned as a stable, commuter-friendly neighborhood within New York City. Its modern development dates back to 1901, when L. H. Green began building out the community after the Long Island Rail Road introduced service to the area. That rail connection remains central to the neighborhood’s economic fabric: the Auburndale station on the Port Washington Branch provides regular service to and from Manhattan, supporting both weekday commuter flows and local business activity that benefits from reliable access to the central business districts. The neighborhood’s identity is closely tied to this rail infrastructure, which effectively integrates Auburndale into broader regional labor and consumer markets.

While primarily known for its low-rise housing stock, Auburndale’s built environment and institutions also support a range of local services. Francis Lewis High School, the largest public high school in the neighborhood, draws a substantial daily population of students, staff, and visitors, sustaining surrounding retail and service uses. The Queens Public Library’s Auburndale Branch on Francis Lewis Boulevard further anchors community activity and can help drive pedestrian traffic for nearby commercial storefronts. Demographically, the area is dense and diverse, with nearly 20,000 residents over roughly 785 acres and a population density of 25.5 inhabitants per acre, providing a sizable customer base within walking or short-travel distance for neighborhood-serving retail.

Auburndale’s transportation framework extends beyond the LIRR. The Clearview Expressway (I-295) and the Long Island Expressway (I-495) traverse or border the neighborhood, offering efficient vehicular access across Queens and to Long Island, which can be advantageous for service businesses and professional offices that draw from a wider catchment. Multiple bus routes, including the Q12, Q13, Q16, Q26, Q27, Q28, Q30, Q31, Q76, and Nassau Inter-County Express n20G, connect Auburndale to nearby commercial nodes and transit hubs, such as Flushing–Main Street on the 7 and 7 trains. This multimodal connectivity underpins a neighborhood environment where small-scale commercial uses can leverage steady foot traffic and strong regional linkages, even as community groups work to maintain the area’s predominantly low-rise, suburban-style character.
