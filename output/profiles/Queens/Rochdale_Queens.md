### Key Details

### Around the Block

Rochdale Village was conceived as a "city within a city" on the former Jamaica Race Course, with the explicit goal of boosting tourism and economic activity in the surrounding Greater Jamaica area, including Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, and Laurelton. The 120-acre site was planned as an attractive community covering 122 blocks, designed with a park-like layout and the facilities of suburbia, all within the urban context of southeastern Queens. While primarily residential, the scale and density of 20 high-rise buildings, grouped into five circular clusters, generate a substantial and stable customer base that underpins local retail and service uses in and around the complex. Early planning framed the development as a regional draw, building on the racecourse legacy as the area’s major tourist attraction, signaling a longstanding intention for concentrated commercial and civic activity on this site.

Today, Rochdale Village sustains a modest but important commercial footprint anchored by two shopping malls and institutional uses that cater to both residents and neighboring communities. The on-site Queens Public Library branch and several local schools, including August Martin High School and multiple public and Montessori schools, bring daily foot traffic and daytime population that support nearby vendors and services. A standout asset from a commercial and operational perspective is the 21-megawatt cogeneration facility, which independently supplies all electrical power, heating, air-conditioning, and domestic hot water for the complex and the two shopping malls, insulating local businesses from wider grid disruptions. Security and property oversight are enhanced by the Rochdale Village Department of Public Safety, supplemented by coverage from the NYPD’s 113th Precinct, which together contribute to a managed, campus-like environment. Transit access is a key driver of commercial viability: the Long Island Rail Road’s Atlantic Branch stops at Locust Manor station directly by the complex, and numerous bus routes connect Rochdale to Jamaica, JFK Airport, and other Queens neighborhoods, facilitating employee, customer, and logistics movement. Although a planned subway extension in the 1970s was never completed, the combination of rail and extensive bus service maintains connectivity sufficient to support neighborhood-serving retail, community services, and institutional tenants across the development.
