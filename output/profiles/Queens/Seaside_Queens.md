### Around the Block

Seaside sits on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, positioned between Rockaway Beach to the east and Rockaway Park to the west, giving it a strategic location along one of the borough’s key oceanfront corridors. Historically it functioned as a resort community of small seasonal bungalows, which shaped its early commercial character around visitors and warm-weather activity. Over time, the neighborhood’s built form has shifted significantly, with middle-income high-rise Mitchell-Lama apartment buildings now dominating the south shore beachfront. This shift in density and housing type creates a more stable, year-round customer base for ground-floor retail, neighborhood services, and community-oriented uses.

The main commercial spine of Seaside is organized around its major roads: Rockaway Beach Boulevard, Rockaway Freeway, and the never-finished Shore Front Parkway. These thoroughfares structure vehicular movement across the peninsula and provide visibility for any street-level retail or commercial uses that align with the corridor. Rockaway Beach Boulevard, in particular, functions as a key east–west route that connects Seaside with Rockaway Beach and Rockaway Park, allowing businesses to draw from a wider Rockaway customer base. The presence of the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, whose southern end is located between Seaside and Rockaway Park, further enhances regional access by linking the Rockaways to the rest of Queens and beyond, increasing potential pass-through traffic. Transit access is reinforced by two New York City Subway stations on the IND Rockaway Line, served by the A and S trains, at Beach 105th Street and Beach 98th Street, providing consistent commuter flow and supporting transit-oriented commercial opportunities. Together, the bridge connectivity, key arterials, and subway stops create a framework where neighborhood-serving retail and services can cluster to serve residents, beachgoers, and travelers moving along the peninsula.
