### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Sunnyside is a western Queens neighborhood organized along Queens Boulevard and the elevated 7 train, with a mix of six-story apartment buildings, planned low-rise districts, and small commercial strips serving a dense local population.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area combines a historic planned community in Sunnyside Gardens and legacy cultural venues with active business organizations such as the Sunnyside Shines Business Improvement District and the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce that support local commerce.


- **THE MARKET:** With a population density of about 27 inhabitants per acre and coverage by three ZIP Codes, the neighborhood offers steady foot traffic for small businesses along Queens Boulevard and surrounding avenues; large-scale industrial or warehouse uses are secondary to mixed-use and community-serving retail.

### Around the Block

Sunnyside in western Queens has evolved from its origins as Sunnyside Hill Farms into a tightly built, transit-oriented neighborhood with strong local commerce. The construction of the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 catalyzed its development as a bedroom community, and today a large portion of the area consists of six-story apartment buildings dating from the 1920s and 1930s. This residential density underpins a network of storefronts, eateries, and service businesses, many of them organized along and near Queens Boulevard, Greenpoint Avenue, and Skillman Avenue. The Sunnyside Gardens Historic District, a landmarked community of homes and small apartment buildings constructed from 1924 to 1928, adds a distinct built form that differentiates it from more conventional multifamily corridors elsewhere in Queens. Active business entities such as the Sunnyside Shines Business Improvement District and the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce provide on-the-ground support, marketing, and streetscape attention for local enterprises.

Cultural and entertainment uses have long contributed to Sunnyside’s commercial identity. The historic Coventry/Popcorn Pub on Queens Boulevard at 47th Street once hosted early performances by KISS and the Ramones, tying the neighborhood to New York’s music history. Earlier in the 20th century, the Sunnyside Garden Arena operated as a boxing and wrestling venue from the 1940s to 1977, bringing visitors and ancillary business to the area; a memorial plaque now marks the site. Community organizations and houses of worship occupy former industrial and commercial buildings, such as the New York Presbyterian Church, whose 1932 structure was originally the Knickerbocker Laundry Factory, illustrating adaptive reuse of older industrial stock. The nearby Sunnyside Yard, a major Amtrak railyard used as a staging area for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains from Penn Station, reinforces the neighborhood’s role within regional rail operations, even though it is not a typical retail destination.

Transit accessibility is a defining asset for Sunnyside’s commercial environment. The elevated 7 train serves three local stations in the neighborhood—33rd Street–Rawson Street, 40th Street–Lowery Street, and 46th Street–Bliss Street—bringing consistent flows of riders directly above Queens Boulevard and adjacent commercial blocks. Multiple bus routes, including the Q32, Q39, Q60, Q104, and B24, stitch Sunnyside to nearby Queens neighborhoods and to Brooklyn, expanding the customer base for local businesses. The Long Island Expressway and the Queens Midtown Tunnel connect the area efficiently to Manhattan, while the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway links it southward and westward to Brooklyn and other industrial and residential districts. Looking ahead, the Penn Station Access project plans a new Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North station at Queens Boulevard along the LIRR Main Line in Sunnyside, promising one-stop access to Midtown Manhattan and likely boosting visibility and demand for nearby retail and services. Together, these roadway and rail connections make Sunnyside an accessible node for small-scale commerce and community-oriented services.
