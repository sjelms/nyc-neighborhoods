### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Hollis is a largely residential, middle-class neighborhood characterized by low-rise, single-family housing stock with limited mention of major commercial or industrial corridors in the available text.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its proximity to Jamaica’s larger commercial hub, nearby hospitals, and multiple transit options, including Long Island Rail Road and several bus routes, support small-scale local services and commuter-oriented businesses.


- **THE MARKET:** With a stable population density of 38.6 inhabitants per acre and a 2017 median household income of $61,670 at the Community Board 12 level, Hollis presents primarily neighborhood-serving retail and service opportunities rather than large-scale commercial or industrial uses.

### Around the Block

Hollis, in southeastern Queens, is presented in the text as a predominantly residential middle-class neighborhood with a long-established housing base of mostly single-family homes. Its development history, shifting from rural homesteads to a platted residential community in the late 19th century, has left relatively little industrial or heavy commercial infrastructure inside the neighborhood boundaries. Instead, Hollis relies heavily on adjacency to Jamaica, a larger and more commercially intense center to the west, for many employment, retail, and institutional functions, including major hospitals such as Jamaica Hospital and Queens Hospital Center. Public facilities such as NYPD’s 103rd Precinct coverage and the local FDNY Engine Co. 301/Ladder Co. 150 provide essential services that support day-to-day neighborhood operations and help sustain small, local businesses. 

Transit infrastructure is one of Hollis’s key commercial assets. The Hollis Long Island Rail Road station on the Hempstead Branch provides regional rail connectivity, which is complemented by the nearby Holban Yard, a long-standing freight yard serving the area and adjoining St. Albans. This yard and the adjacent Hillside Maintenance Facility indicate a significant rail operations presence, which can influence surrounding land use patterns and support ancillary logistics or service activity, even if not described in detail. On the surface transit side, an extensive network of MTA bus routes (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q36, Q43, Q76, Q77, Q82, Q110) and Nassau Inter-County Express routes (n1, n6, n6X, n22, n24, n26) converge along key arterials like Hillside Avenue and Francis Lewis Boulevard, creating nodes that naturally attract neighborhood retail, food, and personal-service businesses catering to commuters. The proximity of the E, F, and F subway trains at Jamaica–179th Street, although just outside Hollis proper, further boosts regional accessibility for residents and workers. Public amenities such as the Queens Public Library’s Hollis and South Hollis branches, along with small open spaces like Liberty Triangle Park, add modest community foot traffic that can support surrounding micro-retail, convenience stores, and service establishments, even though the text does not catalog specific commercial corridors.
