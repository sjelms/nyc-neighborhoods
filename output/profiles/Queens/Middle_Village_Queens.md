## Middle Village

Middle Village is a neighborhood in the central section of the borough of Queens, New York City, bounded to the north by the Long Island Expressway, to the east by Woodhaven Boulevard, to the south by Cooper Avenue and the former LIRR Montauk Branch railroad tracks, and to the west by Mount Olivet Cemetery. The small trapezoid-shaped area bounded by Mt. Olivet Crescent to the east, Fresh Pond Road to the west, Eliot Avenue to the north, and Metropolitan Avenue and Admiral Avenue to the south is often counted as part of Middle Village, but is sometimes considered part of nearby Ridgewood.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Middle Village is a low- to mid-scale commercial neighborhood anchored by Metropolitan Avenue retail, small service businesses, cemeteries, and institutional uses, with a major enclosed shopping center at Metro Mall/Rentar Plaza and limited large-format commercial product beyond that complex.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area blends legacy industrial and utility uses—such as the historic telephone-booth factory site now converted to a mall, a large crematory/columbarium complex, and extensive cemetery acreage—with stable, long-established local retail and civic institutions along its main corridors.


- **THE MARKET:** The commercial market centers on Metropolitan Avenue and Eliot Avenue, with Metro Mall (rebranding as the Shops at Rentar Plaza) providing big-box space for tenants like BJ’s Wholesale Club and Raymour & Flanigan and hosting logistics, public-agency, and training functions, while surrounding blocks support small neighborhood-serving storefronts and religious, educational, and community facilities.

### Around the Block

Middle Village’s commercial character is defined primarily by its spine along Metropolitan Avenue, where retail strips, religious institutions, and legacy commercial buildings line the corridor. The most prominent asset is Metro Mall, a tri-level shopping center developed in the 1970s on the former C.B. French/Western Electric telephone-booth factory site, demonstrating the neighborhood’s shift from light manufacturing to large-format retail and services. Over time, Metro Mall’s tenant mix has evolved from traditional anchors like Kmart and Toys "R" Us to a more logistics- and value-oriented profile, with BJ’s Wholesale Club and Raymour & Flanigan remaining as key retail draws. Vacant upper-level space has been repurposed by the New York City Department of Transportation as storage, by Amazon for a fulfillment center, and by the Department of Correction for a training academy, underscoring the center’s role as a flexible, mixed commercial and institutional hub.

Metropolitan Avenue also hosts several historically significant commercial properties. The Frank T. Lang Building at Metropolitan Avenue and 69th Street, dating to 1904, reflects the corridor’s early role in the funerary and monument trade linked to nearby cemeteries, and has housed various commercial uses including a gas station. The former Niederstein’s restaurant site, long a hospitality landmark along the old Williamsburgh and Jamaica Turnpike, has turned over to modern chain food service, now occupied by an Arby’s, illustrating ongoing redevelopment pressure on older roadside assets. Other notable structures include the former Arion Theater, now a Salvation Army site, and the Artistic Building with its distinctive façade, which continues to support small-scale retail such as a tailor’s shop.

A substantial share of Middle Village’s land base is occupied by cemeteries and related institutions, which, while not traditional revenue-generating retail, anchor a steady stream of visitors and long-term institutional presence. Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery, St. John’s Cemetery, and the Fresh Pond Crematory and Columbarium together create a significant concentration of memorial-related uses that historically supported hotels, restaurants, and monument businesses in the immediate vicinity. These uses limit dense commercial redevelopment on large tracts but help preserve a stable environment around existing corridors. Juniper Valley Park and smaller plazas such as the Middle Village Veteran’s Triangle contribute recreational and civic open space that enhances the area’s appeal for neighborhood-serving retail and services.

Institutional and community facilities play a strong role in the local daytime population. Multiple churches, a remaining synagogue, Catholic schools, a regional Catholic high school, and the Queens Public Library’s Middle Village branch all front or sit near the main commercial arteries, providing consistent foot traffic and demand for convenience retail. The post office at 71-35 Metropolitan Avenue further reinforces the corridor as a civic and service center. While the neighborhood does not feature the dense office or industrial clusters seen elsewhere in Queens, its mix of big-box retail, logistics functions at the mall, and steady community and cemetery-related traffic support a modest but durable commercial ecosystem. Adaptive reuse of older buildings and careful rezoning—pursued in part to limit aggressive redevelopment—have helped Middle Village maintain its low-rise character while accommodating contemporary retail and service needs.
