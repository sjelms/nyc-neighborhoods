### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Rego Park offers a dense mix of local retail strips and large-format shopping centers, anchored by Queens Boulevard, 63rd Drive/Road, and the Rego Center complex, with substantial parking and strong visibility from the Long Island Expressway.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The neighborhood combines major regional retail destinations with older one-story 1930s taxpayer storefronts and ethnic restaurants, creating a varied streetscape that also reflects strong Bukharan and broader immigrant commercial influences.


- **THE MARKET:** Retail is led by Rego Center Phases I and II and several smaller shopping corridors along 63rd Drive/Road and 108th Street, while new mixed-use projects such as the residential tower above Rego Center Phase II indicate ongoing investment driven by rising demand from young professionals.

### Around the Block

Rego Park’s commercial core is defined by a hierarchy of shopping environments, from regional-scale centers to fine-grained local storefronts. The flagship asset is Rego Center, a 277,000-square-foot, four-story shopping complex with a multilevel parking garage developed by Vornado Realty Trust, positioned as one of Queens’ most popular shopping destinations. Phase II of Rego Center, opened in 2010 across 62nd Drive, added approximately 950,000 square feet of additional retail space, briefly including a small-format IKEA—the first of its type in the U.S.—before its closure in 2022. These large footprints, structured parking facilities, and immediate proximity to the Long Island Expressway make the district a powerful draw for both neighborhood shoppers and consumers from surrounding Queens submarkets.

Complementing the big-box and mall-style retail, Rego Park maintains active, older retail corridors that support small businesses and neighborhood-serving commerce. The main business thoroughfare, 63rd Drive, runs from Woodhaven Boulevard north to Queens Boulevard and forms the central business district between Alderton Street and Queens Boulevard. Most buildings lining this stretch are original single-story taxpayer properties dating from the 1930s, occupied by a wide mix of shops and services and intersected by secondary commercial side streets such as Saunders, Booth, Wetherole, and Austin Streets. North of Queens Boulevard, the corridor continues as 63rd Road for several blocks with additional small businesses, while 108th Street hosts another cluster of smaller stores, bakeries, pharmacies, and restaurants. Together, these corridors capture the area’s ethnic diversity with Uzbek, Tajik, kosher, and other international food and retail operators.

Regional access and transit strongly reinforce Rego Park’s commercial position. Queens Boulevard, an at-grade 12-lane highway running under the IND Queens Boulevard subway line, carries both vehicular traffic and four subway services—E, F, M, and R—with local stations at 63rd Drive and 67th Avenue. This combination of highway exposure and heavy transit ridership sustains both destination retail centers and ground-floor storefronts. Woodhaven Boulevard, Horace Harding Expressway (the service road to the Long Island Expressway), and the historic Long Island Rail Road Main Line corridor further knit the neighborhood into Queens’ broader logistics and commuting network, even though the former Rego Park LIRR station has been closed since 1962. With new residential construction atop and around retail, such as the 312-unit tower above Rego Center Phase II, merchants benefit from an immediate and growing consumer base in addition to regional shoppers.
