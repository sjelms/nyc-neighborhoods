### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Astoria Heights, also called Upper Ditmars, is a quiet, low-scale section of Astoria/East Elmhurst characterized primarily by one- and two-family private homes, with limited mention of significant commercial corridors or industrial uses.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its location between Bowery Bay, LaGuardia Airport, and major arterial roads gives Astoria Heights proximity to aviation-related infrastructure and waterfront areas while remaining relatively insulated from the heavier industrial and studio activity found elsewhere in Astoria.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial activity is minimally described for Astoria Heights itself; nearby Astoria more broadly supports a mix of retail corridors and industrial/commercial uses, but Astoria Heights is portrayed as mainly residential, suggesting limited commercial inventory within its boundaries.

### Around the Block

Astoria Heights, or Upper Ditmars, sits at the northeastern edge of greater Astoria, positioned between Hazen Street to the west and La Guardia Airport to the east, with Bowery Bay and Astoria Boulevard/Grand Central Parkway forming its other edges. Within this defined pocket, the land use is described as mostly one- and two-family homes, implying a built form that is low-rise and not dominated by large-scale commercial or industrial structures. Its adjacency to La Guardia Airport and Bowery Bay, however, places the neighborhood directly alongside important transportation and waterfront infrastructure, which shapes access and potential ancillary service activity without being described as heavily industrial itself. The nearby Rikers Island Bridge begins at the north end of Hazen Street, tying Astoria Heights into the circulation network that serves New York City’s main jail complex, though Rikers Island is technically in the Bronx and receives mail from East Elmhurst.

While the core of Astoria Heights is portrayed as quiet, its context within greater Astoria links it to a broad mix of commercial and industrial functions. To the south and west in Astoria and Ravenswood, the corridor along Vernon Boulevard combines residential, commercial, and industrial areas, while Steinway Street functions as a major commercial street with many retail stores. Historically, portions of the waterfront such as Ravenswood evolved from high-end residential to heavily commercial by 1900 and remain commercial today, including major infrastructure like the Ravenswood Generating Station, which can produce roughly 20 percent of New York City’s electricity demand. Farther west and south, Astoria’s legacy as a filmmaking and industrial center continues through Kaufman Astoria Studios, Silvercup Studios, the Museum of the Moving Image, and manufacturing-related properties such as the Steinway & Sons piano factory and the Modern Art Foundry.

Astoria Heights benefits indirectly from this broader ecosystem of employment, production, and cultural facilities in Astoria without hosting large concentrations of such uses inside its own boundaries. The neighborhood’s proximity to the Grand Central Parkway and Astoria Boulevard provides vehicular access linking it to the rest of Queens and to airport-related movements, while nearby commercial corridors in Ditmars, Steinway, and along 21st Street offer retail, services, and mixed-use environments that support both local residents and workers in surrounding districts. Its relationship with East Elmhurst, which shares postal and airport-adjacent characteristics, further underscores Astoria Heights’ position as a quieter enclave at the edge of a much more commercially and industrially active part of western Queens.
