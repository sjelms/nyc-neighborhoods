## Ridgewood

Ridgewood is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens .  It borders the Queens neighborhoods of Maspeth to the north, Middle Village to the east, and Glendale to the southeast, as well as the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bushwick to the southwest and East Williamsburg to the west. Historically, the neighborhood straddled the Queens-Brooklyn boundary.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Ridgewood is a Queens neighborhood whose main corridors—Myrtle, Forest, and Metropolitan Avenues and Fresh Pond Road—are lined with low‑density commercial uses, banks, and local services, supported by strong transit links including the M and L subway lines and multiple bus routes.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Large portions of Ridgewood are designated national and city historic districts, giving its commercial strips and mixed-use blocks a distinctive early‑20th‑century brick streetscape anchored by legacy institutions like Ridgewood Savings Bank’s 1929 headquarters.


- **THE MARKET:** Land use is predominantly residential with commercial zoning concentrated on key avenues; historically the northern section near Newtown Creek held factories and mills while current activity includes neighborhood retail, banking, fitness in an adaptively reused theater building, and transit-related facilities such as the Fresh Pond Yard and Fresh Pond Bus Depot.

### Around the Block

Ridgewood’s commercial spine runs along Myrtle Avenue, Forest Avenue, Metropolitan Avenue, and Fresh Pond Road, where low‑density commercial districts create a continuous neighborhood retail environment. Myrtle Avenue’s Business Improvement District extends from Wyckoff Avenue to Fresh Pond Road, ending where the elevated Bay Ridge Branch of the Long Island Rail Road crosses Myrtle and marks the border with Glendale, underscoring how freight and rail infrastructure still shape local geography. These corridors host street‑level storefronts often integrated into early‑20th‑century brick mixed‑use buildings, many of which fall within the area’s numerous historic districts. The presence of Ridgewood Savings Bank’s limestone headquarters at Myrtle and Forest Avenues, in operation since 1929, signals long‑standing financial and professional services in the neighborhood core. Nearby, the former Ridgewood Theater Building, a 1,950‑seat William Fox movie house from 1916, has been converted into a Blink Fitness, exemplifying adaptive reuse of legacy entertainment real estate for contemporary commercial tenants.

Historically, Ridgewood’s southern blocks developed as dense residential stock, while its northern section closer to Newtown Creek supported industrial factories and mills that tied into the broader Brooklyn‑Queens manufacturing belt. Rail infrastructure remains important: the elevated Bay Ridge Branch runs over Myrtle Avenue, and the Fresh Pond Yard at the end of the Myrtle Avenue Line serves as storage and operations space for M trains. On the surface, the Fresh Pond Bus Depot houses and services many of the buses that run through Brooklyn and Queens, reinforcing Ridgewood’s role as a transit operations hub rather than just a pass‑through stop. The Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues station in the southern portion of Ridgewood functions as a multimodal node, connecting the M and L trains with a large cluster of bus routes and a dedicated Ridgewood Terminal. Extensive bus coverage, including multiple B and Q routes, links neighborhood retailers and services to customers and workers from a wide catchment area. Together, these historic commercial corridors, preserved building stock, and transit and bus facilities create a neighborhood environment where everyday retail, personal services, and small institutions operate in close proximity to key transportation infrastructure that supports both local commerce and broader regional mobility.
