### Around the Block

Laurelton, in southeastern Queens, presents a commercial environment dominated by Merrick Boulevard, which bisects the neighborhood in an east–west direction and functions as its principal business spine. This corridor likely hosts much of the area’s day-to-day service retail, professional offices, and neighborhood-serving uses, supported by the surrounding stable residential blocks. The absence of high-rise development and the predominance of low-rise structures shape a streetscape where ground-floor commercial and community facilities can operate at a modest scale, with minimal pressure for large-format vertical intensification. Proximity to other neighborhoods such as Rosedale, Cambria Heights, and Springfield Gardens positions Laurelton within a broader southeastern Queens consumer catchment, with Merrick Boulevard naturally drawing traffic from nearby communities.

Transportation infrastructure is a key commercial asset. The neighborhood is served by Belt Parkway exits 24A/B, 23A, and 22, with the segment known as the Laurelton Parkway forming part of the city’s greenway and bikeway system. The 1.5‑mile restoration of this link, completed in 2006, enhances access and visibility along the corridor and may support both commuter and recreational traffic that benefits nearby businesses. The Laurelton Long Island Rail Road station at 225th Street and 141st Road provides direct regional connectivity via the Far Rockaway and Long Beach branches, improving access for workers, customers, and potential office or service tenants who value rail proximity. Multiple local bus routes (Q5, Q77, Q84, Q85, Q86, Q87, Q89) connect Laurelton to subway hubs in Jamaica, integrating the neighborhood into the broader city transit network. Express bus routes QM63 and QM65 offer direct service to Manhattan, which can support professional commuters and small office-based enterprises that serve citywide clients while operating from a lower-cost, outer-borough location.
