### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Queensboro Hill is a South Flushing subsection with a major institutional anchor in NewYork–Presbyterian/Queens hospital and local neighborhood-serving retail along its bordering corridors.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its South Flushing location near the Long Island Expressway, Queensboro Hill benefits from adjacency to Kissena Park and access to Turtle Playground, adding green space amenities that can support healthcare, community, and service-oriented uses.


- **THE MARKET:** Queensboro Hill falls within ZIP Codes 11355 and 11367 and is often referred to as South Flushing, with land use oriented around medical facilities, community institutions, and supporting low- to mid-rise neighborhood commercial stock rather than large-scale office or industrial uses.

### Around the Block

Queensboro Hill sits in the southern portion of Flushing, positioned as a distinct subsection within the broader, highly active Flushing market. It is bordered by College Point Boulevard to the west, Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park to the north, Reeves Avenue and the Long Island Expressway to the south, and Kissena Boulevard to the east. This location links the area directly to one of Queens’ primary east–west freight and commuter routes, Interstate 495, while the north–south edges connect into Flushing’s dense commercial and institutional framework. The presence of NewYork–Presbyterian/Queens hospital inside Queensboro Hill gives the area a strong medical and healthcare-services identity, with spillover demand for clinics, professional offices, and health-related retail. Supporting institutions, such as the Queensboro Hill Community Church, add to the daily foot traffic patterns and neighborhood stability that can benefit small-format commercial uses.

While Downtown Flushing functions as one of New York City’s largest outer-borough central business districts, Queensboro Hill plays a more local but complementary role. It is closely tied to nearby parkland, with Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park directly to its north and Turtle Playground serving local residents. These open spaces provide attractive settings for community-oriented facilities and help support demand for food service, convenience retail, and recreation-related businesses. Queensboro Hill’s association with South Flushing and its ZIP Codes 11355 and 11367 aligns it with a larger catchment that includes Pomonok and other nearby subsections where large housing complexes, cooperatives, and public facilities generate consistent local spending power. Although the text does not reference heavy industry or warehouse clusters within Queensboro Hill itself, its proximity to major arterials like the Long Island Expressway suggests good vehicular access for service providers and logistics-light businesses catering to the hospital and surrounding neighborhoods.
