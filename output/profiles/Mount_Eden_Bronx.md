### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Tremont is a compact West Bronx neighborhood organized around East Tremont Avenue and the Grand Concourse, with a street grid dominated by mid-rise apartment buildings and dense local retail and service uses at ground level.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area’s hilly topography, stair streets, historic Morris Avenue brownstones, and early 20th-century civic buildings such as the Tremont branch library and former Tremont Temple provide distinctive architectural character within an otherwise utilitarian urban fabric.


- **THE MARKET:** With extremely high population density, modest median incomes, and a concentration of bodegas and small storefronts rather than large supermarkets, Tremont supports value-oriented neighborhood retail and services along its primary corridors, benefiting from strong transit access via the IND Concourse Line, multiple bus routes, and a Metro-North station.

### Around the Block

Tremont in the West Bronx is a dense, transit-rich neighborhood whose commercial life is structured around East Tremont Avenue, the Grand Concourse, and Webster and Third Avenues. East Tremont Avenue functions as the primary thoroughfare, carrying significant bus traffic and linking a continuous run of local businesses that serve the surrounding walk-to market. The Grand Concourse not only runs through the neighborhood but also anchors important subway connectivity, which is critical for workers, customers, and small operators who rely on public transit access. The neighborhood’s land use is dominated by 5- and 6-story apartment houses, which sit on a relatively small land area and generate very high population density, creating steady foot traffic for ground-floor retail and service-oriented tenants. These residential buildings, paired with heavy bus coverage, underpin demand for bodegas, personal services, and small-format food and convenience operators throughout Tremont and nearby Belmont.

Topographically, Tremont is elevated and very hilly, which has led to the development of stair streets connecting areas at different elevations; this shapes pedestrian circulation and can concentrate commercial activity at flatter, more accessible nodes like East Tremont Avenue and the Grand Concourse. Historic assets, such as the Morris Avenue Historic District’s attached brownstones and the early 20th-century Carnegie library on Washington Avenue, contribute to a distinctive streetscape that can support niche office, institutional, or community-based uses. Civic and public-sector anchors—including the NYPD’s 48th Precinct, two FDNY engine companies, multiple public and parochial schools, and a U.S. Postal Service station on East Tremont Avenue—bring daily employee and visitor traffic into the area. Health facilities are found in adjacent neighborhoods at St Barnabas Hospital in Belmont and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in Claremont, extending the functional trade area for Tremont’s secondary medical, food, and service retail. Overall, Tremont’s combination of high density, extensive bus and subway coverage, and modest income levels favors local-serving retail, institutional, and community uses rather than large-format or luxury commercial development.
