## Bergen Beach

Bergen Beach is a residential neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn , New York City . It is located on a peninsula abutting Jamaica Bay in the southeastern portion of the borough, and is bordered by Mill Basin and the neighborhood of the same name to the south and west; the neighborhood of Flatlands to the northwest; Paerdegat Basin and the neighborhood of Canarsie to the northeast; and Jamaica Bay and the Belt Parkway to the east. Bergen Beach contains a sub-neighborhood named Georgetown. The vast majority of residents are white, and the neighborhood generally has a suburban quality.

### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Bergen Beach is a low-density, predominantly one- and two-family residential peninsula with small commercial overlays, limited retail, and a generally suburban streetscape supporting neighborhood-serving businesses rather than destination retail.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Its waterfront setting on Jamaica Bay, recreational parks, horseback riding academy within the adjacent Gateway National Recreation Area, and a gated condominium complex provide lifestyle and leisure-driven demand for local services despite relatively weak transit access.


- **THE MARKET:** Most land is zoned residential, with small commercial overlays and a light industrial strip along Bergen Basin; retail is concentrated in nearby centers such as the Georgetown Shopping Center, and limited transit plus high car usage shape auto-oriented neighborhood retail and service uses.

### Around the Block

Bergen Beach sits on a Jamaica Bay peninsula at the southeastern edge of Brooklyn, with a land use pattern that is overwhelmingly residential but still carries traces of its resort and maritime past. Historically, the area was home to the Bergen Beach amusement park and a small boardwalk district, drawing visitors via the Flatbush Avenue streetcar and ferry piers at Avenues V and X. Those facilities are gone, but the geographic reality remains: this is a fringe waterfront neighborhood, adjacent to Canarsie, Flatlands, Mill Basin, and Jamaica Bay, with commercial activity clustered at the margins rather than in a dense core. The built environment today is defined by one- and two-family homes, with small commercial overlays that support local retail and service tenants, and a strip along Bergen Basin that is specifically zoned for light industrial uses.

Commercially, the primary draw for daily needs is the Georgetown Shopping Center just to the north, along with a Key Food supermarket in neighboring Mill Basin, which together function as the main retail corridors serving Bergen Beach residents. Within the neighborhood, the Mill Harbor Condominiums stand out as one of the few gated communities in New York City, generating a stable, car-dependent customer base for nearby service retail and professional offices. Parks such as Joseph T. McGuire Park and Bergen Beach Playground, plus the long-running Jamaica Bay Riding Academy with its 80 stables on 500 acres inside the bordering Gateway National Recreation Area, add recreational traffic and modest ancillary demand for food, convenience, and seasonal services. The Belt Parkway runs along the eastern edge, historically built on the continuous embankment between Mill Basin and Paerdegat Basin, and it is more important to the area’s accessibility than rail transit. Public transit consists only of the B3, B41, and BM1 bus routes, with no subway stations nearby, making Bergen Beach and Georgetown among the furthest Brooklyn neighborhoods from the subway and reinforcing an auto-oriented commercial pattern.
