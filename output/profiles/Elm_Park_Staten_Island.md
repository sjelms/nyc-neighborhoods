### Around the Block

Elm Park, situated in the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, is anchored by a small park that lends its name to the surrounding area extending several blocks to the west. The park sits directly across Innis Street from Port Richmond High School, giving the immediate blocks a strong institutional and community-services presence. Historically, the neighborhood’s identity has evolved through several names—Jacksonville in the 1830s and Lowville in the 1850s—before adopting the current name from elm trees on local physician Dr. John T. Harrison’s estate. This layering of names and uses signals a long-standing, stable community footprint that provides a context for local commerce and services.

Transportation infrastructure has been central to the area’s commercial prospects. Elm Park was once served by the Staten Island Railway’s North Shore Branch at the Elm Park station, located directly beneath Morningstar Road. Although passenger service ended in 1953 and only a dilapidated platform remnant remains, the corridor still represents an important piece of the neighborhood’s transportation legacy. Currently, bus routes S40, S44, S89, S90, and S94 serve Elm Park, underpinning both local mobility and cross-borough connectivity. The last exit on New York State Route 440 before the Bayonne Bridge lies within Elm Park, positioning the area as a gateway node to and from New Jersey. In 2008, Senator Charles Schumer and other Staten Island representatives proposed a Park and Ride facility under the Bayonne Bridge for users of bus service to Bayonne. While residents opposed the plan, local businesses supported it, highlighting commercial interest in leveraging regional commuter flows. Religious and institutional assets, such as St. Adalbert’s Church and one of Staten Island’s two St. Mary’s Cemeteries, further shape land use, drawing regular visitation and supporting small-scale service activity in the vicinity. Together, these transportation links, institutional anchors, and long-standing community assets define Elm Park’s commercial and civic character, even within a primarily residential context.
