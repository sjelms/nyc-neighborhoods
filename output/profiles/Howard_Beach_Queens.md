### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Howard Beach is a low-rise Queens waterfront neighborhood whose primary commercial spine is Cross Bay Boulevard, featuring a mix of legacy local retailers and more recent national chain stores and franchises.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The area combines proximity to JFK Airport and Jamaica Bay with pockets that retain a small fishing-village character, such as Ramblersville, and offers neighborhood-scale shopping centers like the Lindenwood Shopping Center rather than large regional malls.


- **THE MARKET:** The market is dominated by single-family detached housing with some two-family homes and mid-rise co-op and condo buildings in Lindenwood, with commercial demand concentrated on Cross Bay Boulevard and smaller strip centers, and some vulnerability to coastal storm impacts on properties and businesses near the bay.

### Around the Block

Howard Beach presents a layered commercial landscape anchored by Cross Bay Boulevard, which functions as the neighborhood’s main retail corridor. In earlier decades this boulevard was lined largely with locally owned shops and restaurants, but since the 1990s it has seen a growing presence of chain stores and franchises, signaling a shift toward more standardized, regional retail tenants. The corridor also contains key neighborhood services, such as two United States Postal Service facilities—Station A on Cross Bay Boulevard and Station B on 159th Avenue—indicating persistent daily foot traffic and stable service-oriented demand. Lindenwood adds another commercial node through the Lindenwood Shopping Center, which includes a supermarket and roughly twenty stores, plus additional small strip retail along Linden Boulevard next to the Lindenwood Diner. Over time, larger single-use properties such as the former “The Village” supermarket have cycled through multiple commercial formats, including a mall, flea market, bingo hall, private school, and currently a walk‑in medical center, reflecting a flexible, evolving tenant mix tailored to local demand.

Geographically, much of Howard Beach is a peninsula bounded by the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue to the north and Jamaica Bay to the south, with waterways such as Hawtree Creek and Shellbank Basin shaping the block structure and limiting through-streets. This waterfront setting underpins both risk and opportunity for commercial and community assets, as seen during Hurricane Sandy, when a ten‑foot storm surge from Jamaica Bay damaged businesses along Cross Bay Boulevard and infrastructure like the Howard Beach–JFK Airport subway station and the IND Rockaway Line trestle. The Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge carries Cross Bay Boulevard over the bay, linking Howard Beach to Broad Channel and positioning the neighborhood as part of a vehicular and transit conduit toward the Rockaways. Rail access is centered on the Howard Beach–JFK Airport station, where the A train connects with the AirTrain JFK route, providing direct access to the airport and supporting airport‑related worker trips and visitor flows. Bus routes including the Q11, Q41, Q52 SBS, Q53 SBS, several QM express routes, and the B15 in Lindenwood distribute riders across the neighborhood, reinforcing local retail strips and supporting smaller commercial nodes like Gateways Hamilton Beach Park, the final stop for the Q11. The adjacency of Hamilton Beach and Ramblersville, with their close relationship to Jamaica Bay and historic fishing activity, adds a niche, waterside character to the broader Howard Beach trade area.
