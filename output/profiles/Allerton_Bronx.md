### Around the Block

Allerton in the East Bronx is defined by its working-class character and a grid of multi‑unit buildings that provide the customer base for its commercial corridors. White Plains Road and Boston Road function as the primary thoroughfares, concentrating ground‑floor retail, services, and everyday commerce. The presence of four NYCHA developments—Boston Road Plaza, Eastchester Gardens, Parkside Houses, and Pelham Parkway Houses—adds sizable, stable populations that support local shops and neighborhood-oriented businesses. Within Bronxwood, the southern subsection of Allerton, Pelham Parkway Houses and Boston Road Plaza are specifically noted, highlighting this area as a major concentration of both residential density and adjacent commercial activity. Laconia, the northern portion, includes Eastchester Houses, adding another anchor of population and demand north of Allerton Avenue.

The neighborhood’s terrain is low and flat, and land use is heavily geared toward multi‑unit homes with some tenements, particularly within five blocks of the elevated IRT White Plains Road Line. This concentration of housing near the El naturally feeds foot traffic to storefronts along White Plains Road. Public transit is a major asset for the local economy: the 2 and 5 trains stop at Gun Hill Road, Burke Avenue, Allerton Avenue, and Pelham Parkway, while the 5 also serves Gun Hill Road/Seymour Avenue near the Dyre Avenue Line. Numerous Bronx bus routes (Bx8, Bx12 and Bx12 SBS, Bx25, Bx26, Bx28, Bx38, Bx30, Bx39) and Bee‑Line routes to Westchester (60, 61, 62 Limited) traverse Allerton via corridors such as Allerton Avenue, Gun Hill Road, Boston Road, Pelham Parkway, Williamsbridge Road, and White Plains Road. This multimodal access links local commerce to major shopping destinations like Bay Plaza Shopping Center and Co‑op City, as well as to university and employment centers such as Lehman College and Fordham Center. The Bronx River Parkway at the western edge further connects the neighborhood to wider Bronx and regional road networks, reinforcing Allerton’s role as a well‑connected, transit‑served community retail market rather than a heavy industrial zone.
