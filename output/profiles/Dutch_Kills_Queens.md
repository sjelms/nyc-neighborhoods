### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Dutch Kills is a historically industrial subsection of Long Island City centered on Queens Plaza, with a legacy of canal-side manufacturing tied to Newtown Creek and its tributary.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** The canalization of Newtown Creek and Dutch Kills once intensified industry here, and the area’s strategic road and water connections that once moved farm and industrial goods now support dense mixed-use redevelopment.


- **THE MARKET:** Dutch Kills is undergoing a massive rezoning to mixed residential and commercial uses, shifting older industrial parcels toward higher-intensity mixed-use and transit-oriented projects around Queens Plaza.

### Around the Block

Dutch Kills is a historic hamlet folded into today’s Long Island City, and its commercial character has long been defined by infrastructure and logistics. Named for its navigable tributary of Newtown Creek, the area’s waterway originally connected south to the main creek and north to Sunswick Creek, giving early businesses and farms direct access to waterborne commerce. The tributary’s connectivity made Dutch Kills an important node for moving agricultural goods and materials in the 19th century, when the surrounding landscape still supported farms. During the American Revolutionary War, its role as an important road hub, and as the site of a British Army garrison, underscored the strategic significance of these routes, foreshadowing the area’s later evolution into an industrial corridor. These same physical advantages—water access and road connectivity—laid the groundwork for the canalization projects at the end of the 19th century that turned Dutch Kills into a more intensive manufacturing landscape.

When Newtown Creek and the Kills were canalized, industrial development intensified and the district prospered well into the mid‑20th century. Warehouses, factories, and other production uses clustered around the improved waterway and the adjacent road grid, taking advantage of easy access to freight movements in and out of western Queens and Brooklyn. Over time, as Long Island City’s broader industrial base contracted, Dutch Kills’ legacy plants and warehouses became part of a larger pattern of underused industrial stock across the neighborhood. Today, that legacy is being actively reworked under a massive rezoning to mixed residential and commercial properties. Proximity to Queens Plaza and the broader Long Island City transit network makes the area attractive for office, hotel, and residential developers who can reuse or redevelop former industrial parcels. The ongoing transition signals a shift from traditional heavy industry toward higher-density mixed-use and service-oriented activity, while still leveraging the long-established street and infrastructure framework that has defined Dutch Kills for more than a century.
