### Key Details
- **WHAT TO EXPECT:** Mill Basin is a predominantly residential peninsula with limited but focused commercial activity, including family-owned shops and restaurants and the large Kings Plaza shopping mall at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue.


- **UNEXPECTED APPEAL:** Despite its residential zoning, Mill Basin retains a legacy of heavy industry along the waterfront and pockets of derelict factory buildings, alongside marinas and navigable inlets that support boating and small-scale marine commerce.


- **THE MARKET:** Commercial uses are concentrated along Strickland Avenue and Avenue U and in Kings Plaza and Mill Plaza Mall, while the area between Avenue U and the Mill Basin waterway is zoned for heavy industry, offering potential industrial and logistics sites amid a generally low-transit, car-dependent environment.

### Around the Block

Mill Basin’s commercial and industrial character is shaped by its history as a former island in Jamaica Bay that was heavily engineered for port and manufacturing uses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Bulkheads, dredging, and extensive landfill expanded the landmass and created large tracts that were explicitly marketed as suitable for industrial development. Companies such as National Lead, Gulf Refining, and other heavy industry firms operated plants along the Mill Island shoreline, taking advantage of the dredged channels and ship access to Jamaica Bay. A municipally owned pier, dry docks, and a 2‑mile industrial channel within Mill Basin reinforced its role as a manufacturing and maritime logistics node. Although major port and rail connections never fully materialized, these early moves left a physical legacy: a waterfront with industrial zoning between Avenue U and the Mill Basin waterway and remnants of lead factories, some still standing but many derelict. This configuration continues to offer opportunities for warehouse, marine, and industrial users who can benefit from water access, while existing structures and brownfield conditions may require significant repositioning.

Today, the visible commercial spine of Mill Basin is more retail- and service-oriented than industrial. Commercial activities are mainly family-owned shops and restaurants along Strickland Avenue and Avenue U, serving both local residents and visitors drawn to the waterfront setting. The Kings Plaza shopping mall, occupying a 23‑acre site at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue, stands out as Brooklyn’s largest indoor shopping center and a dominant regional retail anchor. It is complemented by the nearby Mill Plaza Mall, a strip mall at Mill and Strickland Avenues that adds convenience retail to the immediate neighborhood. Historically, the nearby Brooklyn Skyport seaplane base and current marinas in Mill Basin Inlet underscore the area’s continuing relationship to waterborne activity, including cargo transfers during Prohibition and ongoing recreational boating supported by a navigable channel. The Belt Parkway and Mill Basin Bridge provide crucial vehicular connectivity along the southern Brooklyn waterfront, offsetting the lack of subway service and supporting both retail access and potential truck movement for industrial parcels. While Mill Basin is now best known for high-end housing, its underlying land-use pattern—a mix of heavy industrial zoning, regional shopping, and legacy factories—creates a distinctive environment for commercial and industrial real estate, with car-dependent access and a large, relatively affluent consumer base nearby.
